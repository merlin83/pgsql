This migration requires a complete dump of the 6.2 or 6.2.1 database and a
restore of the database in 6.3.

In addition, 6.3 has separate permissions for views, rather than relying
on the permissions set on the underlying tables.  For this reason, you will
have to set permissions on your views if you want anything but the default
permissions.

Those migrating from earlier 1.* releases should first upgrade to 1.09
because the COPY output format was improved from the 1.02 release.
