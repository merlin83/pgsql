This migration requires a complete dump of the 6.1 database and a
restore of the database in 6.2.

Note that the pg_dump and pg_dumpall utility from 6.2 should be used
to dump the 6.1 database.

Those migrating from earlier 1.* releases should first upgrade to 1.09
because the COPY output format was improved from the 1.02 release.
