	* src/interfaces/python/pgmodule.c: This patch fixes the well-known
	but unfixed bug that fetchone() always returns the first result in
	the DB-API compliant wrapper. It turned out that the bug was way
	down in the C code.

	* configure: Hmm, looks like Bruce's auto-run-autoconf script
	doesn't work for old branches...

	* src/backend/executor/nodeHash.c: Make hashjoin give the right
	answer with toasted input data.

	* src/: backend/access/heap/heapam.c, backend/executor/execMain.c,
	backend/utils/adt/tid.c, include/access/heapam.h: fix my old fault.

	* configure.in, register.txt, doc/bug.template,
	doc/src/sgml/version.sgml, src/include/config.h.win32,
	src/interfaces/libpq/libpq.rc: Update branding for 7.1.3, no
	HISTORY yet.

	* src/tutorial/Makefile: Fix Cygwin build, per Jason Tishler.

2001-08-08 18:32  tgl

	* src/backend/commands/copy.c: Back-patch fix to disallow COPY
	TO/FROM a view (or anything else that's not a plain relation).

2001-08-08 18:25  tgl

	* src/backend/utils/init/miscinit.c: Back-patch fix to prevent
	infinite loop when $PGDATA is not writable.

	* src/: backend/port/beos/support.c, backend/port/dynloader/beos.c,
	include/port/beos.h: Commit BEOS patch to 7.1.X.

	* src/bin/pg_dump/: pg_dump.c, pg_dump.h: Back-patch fixes for
	dumping user-defined types and dumping comments on views.

	* src/: backend/optimizer/path/allpaths.c,
	backend/optimizer/util/clauses.c, backend/utils/adt/ruleutils.c,
	include/optimizer/clauses.h: Fix optimizer to not try to push WHERE
	clauses down into a sub-SELECT that has a DISTINCT ON clause, per
	bug report from Anthony Wood.  While at it, improve the
	DISTINCT-ON-clause recognizer routine to not be fooled by out-
	of-order DISTINCT lists.  Also, back-patch earlier fix to not push
	down into sub-SELECT with LIMIT.

	* src/bin/pg_dump/pg_dump.c: Arrange for GRANT/REVOKE on a view to
	be dumped at the right time, namely after the view definition
	rather than before it.	Bug introduced in 7.1 by changes to dump
	stuff in OID ordering.

	* doc/src/sgml/backup.sgml: Fix typo. createdb -t --> createdb -T

	* src/test/regress/expected/: abstime-solaris-1947.out,
	abstime.out: In any case, it seems the REL7_1 branch needs the
	update too...

2001-06-29 12:34  tgl

	* src/backend/commands/vacuum.c: Fix longstanding error in VACUUM:
	sometimes would examine a buffer page after writing/unpinning it. 
	An actual failure is unlikely, unless the system is tremendously
	short of buffers ... but a bug is a bug.

	* src/pl/plpgsql/src/pl_exec.c: Back-patch fix for attempt to pfree
	a value that's not palloc'd (it's a field of a tuple).	I see Jan
	has already fixed this in current sources, but 7.1.* is pretty
	badly broken here.

2001-06-12 14:54  tgl

	* src/backend/rewrite/rewriteHandler.c: Repair problem with
	multi-action rules in combination with any nontrivial manipulation
	of rtable/jointree by planner.	Rewriter was generating actions
	that shared rtable/jointree substructure, which caused havoc when
	planner got to the later actions that it'd already mucked up.

	* src/backend/access/transam/xlog.c: Back-patch change to not keep
	WAL segments just for UNDO information.

2001-05-31 17:50  momjian

	* doc/src/sgml/release.sgml: Forgot SGML section section id tag for
	7.1.

2001-05-31 13:33  tgl

	* src/backend/utils/adt/ri_triggers.c: RI triggers would fail for
	datatypes using old-style equal function, because cached fmgr info
	contained reference to a shorter-lived data structure.	Also guard
	against possibility that fmgr_info could fail, leaving an
	incomplete entry present in the hash table.

	* src/backend/utils/mb/conv.c: Fix a message error in utf_to_local

	* src/interfaces/jdbc/org/postgresql/jdbc2/ResultSet.java: Patch
	from Barry Lind to correctly decode time zones in timestamp
	results.   Without patch, the time zone field is ignored and the
	returned time is   not correct.   Already applied to the
	development tree...

2001-05-18 12:00  tgl

	* src/include/catalog/pg_aggregate.h: Correct recently-broken
	avg(interval) definition.  We can't force an initdb to fix this in
	7.1 installations, but it seems better to be shipping a correct
	entry than a wrong one.
