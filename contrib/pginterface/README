   			      Pginterface 2.0

Attached is a copy of the Postgres support routines I wrote to allow me
to more cleanly interface to the libpg library, more like a 4gl SQL
interface.

You can create a library of pginterface.c and halt.c, and just include
pginterface.h in your source code.

I am willing to maintain this if people find problems or want additional
functionality.
