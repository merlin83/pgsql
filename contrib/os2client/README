
19981029  libpq.a and psql.exe Version 6.4 for OS/2 
---------------------------------------------------


Requirements:

emx 0.9c or newer under OS/2
GNU crypt library for emx+gcc version 2.0.6 (available from 
  ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/crypt/gnuufc.zip)


Also a patch is needed for sys/socket.h around line 291.  The lines
with the pluses need to be added, the other lines are already there
and are only for reference:


#define MT_IFADDR       13

+#ifndef MAXSOCKETS
+#define MAXSOCKETS 2048
+#endif

struct mbstat {
        u_short         m_mbufs;
        u_short         m_clusters;


Possible problems:

  You will also need to #define TCPIPV4

  Make sure both socket.a and ufc.a are linked in to the executable 
AFTER libpq.a.

The following include files will be needed in order to use the library.
You only need to include one (libpq-fe.h) but these need to be present:

postgres_ext.h
libpq/pqcomm.h
lib/dllist.h"
c.h


Good luck and enjoy!!
