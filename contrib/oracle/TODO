- Extract sequences on tables. Seem to be difficult, can't find the way to link
  a sequence with one or more column. So problably just dump and edit manually
- More precision in type conversion based on length (I've no good DB to do that)
- Extract triggers and internal function.
- Extract datas.
- SQL queries converter.
