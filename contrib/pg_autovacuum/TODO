--------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Add Startup Message (with datetime stamp) to Logfile when starting and logging 

_create a FSM export function and see if I can use it for pg_autovacuum

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
_Check if required pg_stats are enables, if not exit with error

_Reduce the number connections and queries to the server

	_make table adding and removal part of the normal loop

_Separate logic for vacuum and analyze

_all pg_autovacuum specific functions are now static

_correct usage of snprintf

_reworked database and table update functions, now they
	use the existing database connection and only one query

_fixed -h option output

_cleanup of 'constant == variable' used much more consistently now.

_Guarantee database wide vacuum prior to Xid wraparound

_change name to pg_autovacuum

_Add proper table and database removal functions so that we can properly
	clear up before we exit, and make sure we don't leak memory when removing tables and such.
