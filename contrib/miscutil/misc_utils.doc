query_limit(n)

	sets a limit on the maximum numbers of query returned from
	a backend. It can be used to limit the result size retrieved
	by the application for poor input data or to avoid accidental
	table product while playying with sql.
 
backend_pid()

	return the pid of our corresponding backend.

unlisten(relname)

	unlisten from a relation or from all relations if the argument
	is null, empty or '*'.
	It is now obsoleted by the new unlisten command but still useful
	if you want unlisten a name computed by the query.
	Note that a listen/notify relname can be any ascii string, not
	just valid relation names.

min(x,y)
max(x,y)

	return the min or max bteween two integers.

assert_enable(bool)

	enable/disable assert checkings in the backend, if it has been
	compiled with USE_ASSERT_CHECKING.

	test the assert enable/disable code, if the backend has been
	compiled with ASSERT_CHECKING_TEST.
