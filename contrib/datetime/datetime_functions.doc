Date & time functions for use in Postgres version 6.1 & up

This functions replaces the original ones from the postgresql.org
because the date & time structures has changed.

There is a Makefile that should be "ajusted" 
for directories where postgres home after install.

In this case: /usr/postgres.

Hope this can help,
