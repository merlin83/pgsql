Subject: [PG95]: new postgres functions

- -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Some time ago I read in the mailing list requests of people looking
for more time and date functions.  I have now written some of them:

  time_difference(time1, time2) ,also defined as operator '-'
  hour(time)
  minutes(time)
  seconds(time)
  asMinutes(time)
  asSeconds(time)
  currentTime()
  currentDate()

The file can be compiled as shared library and loaded as dynamic module
without need to recompile the backend.  This can also be taken as an example
of the extensibility of postgres (user-defined functions, operators, etc).
I would be nice to see more of these user contributed modules posted to this
list and hopefully accessible from the Postgres home page.
