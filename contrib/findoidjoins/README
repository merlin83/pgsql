   			      findoidjoins

This program scans a database, and prints oid fields (also regproc fields)
and the tables they join to.  CAUTION: it is ver-r-r-y slow on a large
database, or even a not-so-large one.  We don't really recommend running
it on anything but an empty database.

Uses pgeasy library.

Run on an empty database, it returns the system join relationships (shown
below for 6.5).  Note that unexpected matches may indicate bogus entries
in system tables --- don't accept a peculiar match without question.
In particular, a field shown as joining to more than one target table is
probably messed up.  In 6.5, the *only* field that should join to more
than one target is pg_description.objoid.  (Running make_oidjoins_check
is an easy way to spot fields joining to more than one table, BTW.)

The shell script make_oidjoins_check converts findoidjoins' output
into an SQL script that checks for dangling links (entries in an
OID or REGPROC column that don't match any row in the expected table).
Note that fields joining to more than one table are NOT processed.

The result of make_oidjoins_check should be installed as the "oidjoins"
regression test.  The oidjoins test should be updated after any
revision in the patterns of cross-links between system tables.
(Ideally we'd just regenerate the script as part of the regression
tests themselves, but that seems too slow...)
