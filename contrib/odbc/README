This directory contains support functions for the ODBC driver
supplied with PostgreSQL-7.0.

To enable additional ODBC functions with PostgreSQL-7.0, simply
execute the commands in odbc.sql:

psql
Welcome to psql, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.

       \h for help with SQL commands
       \? for help on internal slash commands
       \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
       \q to quit

postgres=# \i odbc.sql
CREATE
...


To enable additional ODBC functions with versions of PostgreSQL
prior to PostgreSQL-7.0 (e.g. PostgreSQL-6.5.3), build the shared
library and SQL commands as follows:

make pre7
