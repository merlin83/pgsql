I think we're still waiting for someone to figure out what the behavior
should be per spec.

I took a brief look at SQL99, but I couldn't find anything regarding
this issue (AFAICS it doesn't mention "disabled triggers" at all). But
given my prior track record for divining information from the
standards, perhaps someone should double-check :-)

I did notice some behavior which we don't implement AFAIK:

        If the constraint mode is /deferred/, then the constraint is
        effectively checked when the constraint mode is changed to
        /immediate/ either explicitely by execution of a <set
        constraints mode statement>, or implicitely at the end of the
        current SQL-transaction.

(SQL99, Section 4.17.1, paragraph 3)

We don't recheck any outstanding deferred constraints when the
constraint mode is explicitly switched back to IMMEDIATE, as the
standard says we should.

Cheers,

Neil

I had a pretty hard look around SQL99. It does not appear to say anything
explicit about disabling triggers. This should be clear from page 90: 4.35
Triggers. This specifies the trigger descriptor. Those familiar with SQL99
know that it just about mandates that all state information about any
object in the system is recorded in its descriptor. The fact that
enabled/disabled state information is not recorded in the trigger
descriptor suggests that it is only ever enabled.

More over there is no case when a trigger is not executed, according to
10.12 'Execution of triggers'.

I dug deeper, wondering if it may be implicitly disabled given the
disabling of its 'dependencies', shall we call them. Namely: the base
table or the procedure used in the trigger action. Tables cannot be
disabled or made in active. As for the procedure, <SQL procedure
statement>, this expands to SQL which, itself, cannot be 'disabled'.

The spec is a large one and I didn't look at all references to triggers --
since there are hundreds -- but I don't believe that there is any
precedent for an implementation of DISABLE TRIGGER.

FWIW, i think that in the case of deferred triggers they should all be
added to the queue and whether they are executed or not should be
evaluated inside DeferredTriggerExecute() with:

    if(LocTriggerData.tg_trigger->tgenabled == false)
        return;

Thanks for the dig.  I was hoping we could get some guidance from the
spec, but it looks like not.  How about other implementations --- does
Oracle support disabled triggers?  DB2?  etc?

So check the state at execution, not when the triggering event occurs.
I don't have any strong reason to object to that, but I have a gut
feeling that it still needs to be thought about...

Let's see, I guess there are several possible changes of state for a
deferred trigger between the triggering event and the end of
transaction:

* Trigger deleted.  Surely the trigger shouldn't be executed, but should
we raise an error or just silently ignore it?  (I suspect right now we
crash :-()

* Trigger created.  In some ideal world we might think that such a
trigger should be fired, but in reality that ain't gonna happen; we're
not going to record every possible event on the speculation that some
trigger for it might be created later in the transaction.

* Trigger disabled.  Your proposal is to not fire it.  Okay, comports
with the deleted case, if we make that behavior be silently-ignore.

* Trigger enabled.  Your proposal is to fire it.  Seems not to comport
with the creation case --- does that bother anyone?

* Trigger changed from not-deferred to deferred.  If we already fired it
for the event, we surely shouldn't fire it again.  I believe the code
gets this case right.

* Trigger changed from deferred to not-deferred.  As Neil was pointing
out recently, this really should cause the trigger to be fired for the
pending event immediately, but we don't get that right at the moment.
(I suppose a stricter interpretation would be to raise an error because
we can't do anything that really comports with the intended behavior
of either case.)

How do these various cases relate?  Can we come up with a unified
rationale?

Oracle does for sure. With a complex app (i.e. Oracle Applications) 
being able to disable triggers from time-to-time is *indispensable*. Not 
sure about DB2. My knowledge of MSSQL is getting dated, but as of MSSQL7 
I don't *think* you can disable a trigger.

Oracle 8 (and I presume 9) allows you to disable/enable triggers through
alter table and alter trigger. My 8.1.7 documentation is silent on the
cases you mention below and I do not have an oracle installation handy to
test. Anyone?

It doesn't need to be an ideal world. We're only talking about deferred
triggers after all. Why couldn't CreateTrgger() just have a look through
deftrig_events, check for its relid and if its in there, call
deferredTriggerAddEvent().

Agreed.

I think this should generate an error as it doesn't sit well with the
spec IMHO.

Hello,

while there have been suggested some hacks on the system catalog
for disabling/enabling triggers, these have two serious disadvantages:

 - they cannot be done by the owner of the trigger
   (only the DBA has write access to the system catalog)
 - messing in the system catalog for simple DB schema changes makes
   most users feel uneasy

Oracle has an SQL command "ALTER TRIGGER triggername DISABLE|ENABLE".
Were it possible to put this command on the TODO list for a future PG release?

Thanks,

Christoph Dalitz

This would make no sense:

It could be the syntax if the statement for creating a trigger
where "ALTER TABLE ADD TRIGGER".

The statement for creating a trigger is however "CREATE TRIGEER".

Consequently the statement for changing a trigger must be "ALTER TRIGGER"
and not "ALTER TABLE".

Switching off all triggers for an individual table at once would be
convenient of course and can be easily achieved with "ALTER TRIGGER" as well:
just write a little PL/SQL procedure "disable_triggers()" that takes a
tablename as input and disables all triggers on it.

Sementics.

The trigger belongs to the table. 
The trigger is not modified. 
The ability of the table being modified to call it is modified.  
Plus, if you want all the triggers on a table to be disabled the ALTER
TRIGGER is not enough.

OK,

The argument about using ALTER TABLE/ADD FOREIGN KEY in dumps was that it
caused an actual check of the data in the table, right?  This was going to
be much slower than using CREATE CONSTRAINT TRIGGER.

So, why can't we do this in the SQL that pg_dump creates (TODO):

CREATE TABLE ...
ALTER TABLE/ADD FOREIGN KEY ...
update catalogs and disable triggers that the ADD FOREIGN KEY just created
...
COPY .. FROM ...
\.
update catalogs and enable triggers

Doesn't this give us the best of both worlds? ie. Keeps dependencies but
does fast COPYing?

Also, I think a new super-user (or owner) only SQL command would be nice
(TODO):

ALTER TABLE foo {DISABLE|ENABLE} TRIGGER { ALL | trigger_name [ ,... ] };

This is like MSSQL syntax (IIRC):

http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/tsqlref/ts_
aa-az_3ied.asp
Specifies that trigger_name is enabled or disabled. When a trigger is
disabled it is still defined for the table; however, when INSERT, UPDATE, or
DELETE statements are executed against the table, the actions in the trigger
are not performed until the trigger is re-enabled.


It would certainly tidy up the dumps a bit...

The problem with this is you may enable a trigger that was disabled by
the user.  It cannot be done to all triggers.  We could figure out which
triggers were created for the foreign key via pg_depend, then re-enable
only those.

If we did most of this in a single transaction it should be fairly safe.

pg_dump shouldn't need to know that a trigger is involved for foreign
keys.  A SET CONSTRAINTS DISABLED  would be more appropriate in a binary
mode dump -- but I firmly believe that text mode dumps should run full
checks on the data to ensure the user didn't muck with it.
