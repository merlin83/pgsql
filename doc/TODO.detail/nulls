my first suggestion may have been hare-brained, but why not just make the
specifics of the output user-configurable.  So if the user chooses \0, so
be it, if the user chooses \N so be it, if the user likes NULL so be it.
but the option would only have one value per database at any given point
in time.  so database x could use \N on tuesday and NULL on wednesday, but
database x could never have two references to the characters(s) used to
represent a null value.

Watching all this go by...as a guy who has to move alot of data
from legacy dbs to postgres, I've gotten used to \N being a null.

My vote, if I were allowed to cast one, would be to have one null 
and that would be the COPY command null.  I have no difficulty
distinguishing a null from a newline...

At the pgsql command prompt I would find seeing \N rather reassuring.
I've seen alot of these little guys.
