Dear Sirs,

I have been lurking on the PostgreSQL hackers list for about 3 months now
and your names comes up more than any with helpful info about the project
so I was hoping you could help me.

Let me cut to the chase.  I have been experimenting with 7.0.2 source to
see if I could create a mutlti-threaded version of the backend so
I could link directly from java ( I have a fe<->be protocol that I use for
my apps). Needless to say I got into much more than I bargained for.  I
now have a version that works and it has some nice benefits that are very
helpful to a project that I am working on.  What I gained was

prepared statements outside of spi
batched commits (fsync)
one connection per thread
	multiple threads per process
		multiple processes per installation

I never really intended for anyone else to see the work so I drifted
pretty far from the original code.  I also ended up using Solaris threads
rather than pthreads,  I did my own implementation of the bufmgr.c and
gram.y, and used Solaris implementation of mutex in place of S_LOCK and
TAS. I grabbed all global variables and put them in an environment
variable that is thread local.  I also did some really stupid
things like making TransactionId uint64 and making all my inserts use the
same oid.

My question is this.  I would like to get some critical feedback and
suggestions about the work from others.  What is the best way to go about
this?  I thought about trying to create a project on greatbridge.org
but I am rather new to open source and the code needs commented properly
and cleaned up before too many try and look at it.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks in advance,

Myron Scott

I moved all global variables to a thread global variable which is accessed
by the method GetEnv().  Which looks like this

Env* GetEnv(void) {
	Env* env;
	thr_getspecific(*envkey,(void*)&env);
	return env;
}

The Env struct includes the CurrentMemoryContext, TopMemoryContext,
PortalHeapMemory for each instance of a connection (one thread per
connection). So, for example,
EndPortalAllocMode uses GetEnv()->CurrentMemoryContext

void
EndPortalAllocMode()
{
	PortalHeapMemory context;

	AssertState(PortalManagerEnabled);
	AssertState(IsA(GetEnv()->CurrentMemoryContext,
PortalHeapMemory));

	context = (PortalHeapMemory) GetEnv()->CurrentMemoryContext;
	AssertState(PointerIsValid(context->block));		/* XXX
Trap(...) */

	/* free current mode */
	AllocSetReset(&HEAPMEMBLOCK(context)->setData);
	MemoryContextFree((MemoryContext)
PortalHeapMemoryGetVariableMemory(context),
					  context->block);

	/* restore previous mode */
	context->block = FixedStackPop(&context->stackData);
}

For anyone interested,

I have posted my multi-threaded version of PostgreSQL here.

http://www.sacadia.com/mtpg.html

It is based on 7.0.2 and the TAO CORBA ORB which is here.

I know it's a major undertaking, but since the work is sort of done,
have you guys considered the port to solaris threads and seeing about
making a pthreads port of that?

I know it would probably get you considerable gains under Windows
at the expense of dropping some really really legacy system.

Or you could do what apache (is rumored) does and have it do either
threads or processes or both...

I have put a new version of my multi-threaded
postgresql experiment at

http://www.sacadia.com/mtpg.html

This one actually works.  I have added a server
based on omniORB, a CORBA 2.3 ORB from ATT.  It
   is much smaller than TAO and uses the thread per
connection model.  I haven't added the java side
of the JNI interface yet but the C++ side is there.

It's still not stable but it is much better than
the last.

There are many many globals I had to work around including all the memory
management stuff.  I basically threw everything into and "environment"
variable which I stored in a thread specific using thr_setspecific.

Performance is acually very good for what I am doing.  I was able to batch
commit transactions which cuts down on fsync calls, use prepared
statements from my client using CORBA, and the various locking calls for
the threads (cond_wait,mutex_lock, and sema_wait) seem pretty fast.  I did
some performance tests for inserts 

20 clients, 900 inserts per client, 1 insert per transaction, 4 different
tables.

7.0.2    About    10:52 average completion
multi-threaded    2:42 average completion
7.1beta3          1:13 average completion

If I increased the number of inserts per transaction, multi-threaded got
closer to 7.1 for inserts.  I haven't tested other other types of
commands
yet.

 Yes, it's good. I working on multi-thread application server
(http://mape.jcu.cz) and I use for this project some things from PG (like
mmgr), I planning use same solution.

It is very very good for time for 7.1, already look forward to 7.2! :-)  

 BTW, I not sure if you anytime in future will see threads in 
official PostgreSQL and if you spending time on relevant things (IMHO).

There are many many globals I had to work around including all the memory
management stuff.  I basically threw everything into and "environment"
variable which I stored in a thread specific using thr_setspecific.

Performance is acually very good for what I am doing.  I was able to batch
commit transactions which cuts down on fsync calls, use prepared
statements from my client using CORBA, and the various locking calls for
the threads (cond_wait,mutex_lock, and sema_wait) seem pretty fast.  I did
some performance tests for inserts 

20 clients, 900 inserts per client, 1 insert per transaction, 4 different
tables.

7.0.2    About    10:52 average completion
multi-threaded    2:42 average completion
7.1beta3          1:13 average completion

If I increased the number of inserts per transaction, multi-threaded got
closer to 7.1 for inserts.  I haven't tested other other types of
commands
yet.

Now, the question of the week:
Is supporting a thread model for an inefficient OS a desirable thing to do, 
when more efficient OS kernels are available such as FreeBSD 4.x and Linux 
2.4?  My opinion is that our existing model, when used with a 
connection-pooling frontend, is rather efficient.  (Yes, I use a 
connection-pooling frontend.  Performance is rather nice, and I don't have to 
have a full backend spawned for every page hit.)

In fact, on a Linux box threads show as processes.  While I know that the 
kernel actually supports themin a slightly different manner than processes, 
they have more similarities than differences.

However, even on OS's where threads are supported, the mechanism to support 
those threads must be an efficient one -- not all pthreads libraries are 
created equal.  Many are frontends (expensive ones, at that) for plain old 
processes.

Does anyone know of a resource that details the 'weight' of processes for our 
supported platforms?  [reply off-list -- I'll be glad to summarize responses 
to HACKERS, ADMIN, or PORTS, as appropriate, if desired.]

I can only think of two objectives for threading. (1) running the various
connections in their own thread instead of their own process. (2) running
complex queries across multiple threads.

For  item (1) I see no value to this. It is a lot of work with no tangible
benefit. If you have an old fashion pthreads implementation, it will hurt
performance because are scheduled within the single process's time slice.. If
you have a newer kernel scheduled implementation, then you will have the same
scheduling as separate processes. The only thing you will need to do is
switch your brain from figuring out how to share data, to trying to figure
out how to isolate data. A multithreaded implementation lacks many of the
benefits and robustness of a multiprocess implementation.

For item (2) I can see how that could speed up queries in a low utilization
system, and that would be cool, but in a server that is under load, threading
the queries probably be less efficient.

When using a kernel threading model, it's not obvious to me that the
kernel will switch between threads much faster than it will switch
between processes.  As far as I can see, the only potential savings is
not reloading the pointers to the page tables.  That is not nothing,
but it is also not a lot.

Sometimes you need data which is specific to a particular thread.
Basically, you have to look at every global variable in the Postgres
backend, and determine whether to share it among all threads or to
make it thread-specific.  In other words, you have to take extra steps
to isolate the data within the thread.  This is the reverse of the
current situation, in which you have to take extra steps to share data
among all backend processes.

When writing in C, threading inevitably loses robustness.  Erratic
behaviour by one thread, perhaps in a user defined function, can
subtly corrupt the entire system, rather than just that thread.  Part
of defensive programming is building barriers between different parts
of a system.  Process boundaries are a powerful barrier.

(Actually, though, Postgres is already vulnerable to erratic behaviour
because any backend process can corrupt the shared buffer pool.)

I did a multi-threaded version of 7.0.2 using Solaris threads about a year
ago in order to try
and get multiple backend connections working under one java process using
jni.  I used the thread per connection model.

I eventually got it working, but it was/is very messy ( there were global
variables everywhere! ).  Anyway, I was able to get a pretty good speed up
on inserts by scheduling buffer writes from multiple connections on one
common writing thread.  

I also got some other features that were important to me at the time.

1.  True prepared statements under java with bound input and output
variables
2.  Better system utilization 
	a.  fewer Solaris lightweight processes mapped to threads.
	b.  Fewer open files per postgres installation 
3.  Automatic vacuums when system activity is low by a daemon thread.

but there were some drawbacks...  One rogue thread or bad user 
function could take down all connections for that process.  This
was and seems to still be the major drawback to using threads.

Old fashion ... as in a userland library that implements POSIX threads?  
Well, I would agree.  However, most *modern* implementations are done in 
the kernel or kernel and userland coop model and don't have this 
limitation (as you mention later in your e-mail).  You have kinda hit on 
one of my gripes about computers in general.  At what point in time does 
one say something is obsolete or too old to support anymore - that it 
hinders progress instead of adding a "feature"?

Save for the fact that the kernel can switch between threads faster then 
it can switch processes considering threads share the same address space, 
stack, code, etc.  If need be sharing the data between threads is much 
easier then sharing between processes. 

I can't comment on the "isolate data" line.  I am still trying to figure 
that one out.

That last line is a troll if I every saw it ;-)  I will agree that threads 
isn't for everything and that it has costs just like everything else.  Let 
me stress that last part - like everything else.  Certain costs exist in 
the present model, nothing is - how should we say ... perfect.

Well, I don't follow your logic and you didn't give any substance to back 
up your claim.  I am willing to listen.

Another thought ... Oracle uses threads doesn't it or at least it has a 
single processor and multi-processor version last time I knew ... which do
