Let me guess at the problem. When you add a column, it doesn't change
all the records, therefore the column must be added at the end. This
means that the columns will not be in the same order as if you had
created them from scratch.

There seem to be three solutions:
a) Go to a much more sophisticated schema system, with versions and
version numbers (fairly hard but desirable to fix other schema change
problems). Then insert the column in the position it is supposed to be
in.

b) Fix the copy command to input and output the columns, not in the
order they are in, but in the order they would be in on re-creation.

c) make the copy command take arguments specifying the field names, like
INSERT can do.

I think it would be good if Postgres had all 3 features. Probably (b) is
the least work.

hello all

this is the problem:

example:

test=> CREATE TABLE MAN(name char(10) UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY);T

test=> CREATE TABLE PROFESSOR(scool char(20))INHERITS(MAN);

test=> INSERT INTO PROFESSOR(name) VALUES('DAVIS');
INSERT 54424 1

test=> INSERT INTO PROFESSOR(name) VALUES('DAVIS');
INSERT 54425 1

Does the following indicate a bug? It sure is wierd. Maybe some of these
statements aren't supported by postgresql (??), but the outcome doesn't
make sense to me.

httpd=> CREATE TABLE x (y text);
CREATE
httpd=> CREATE VIEW z AS select * from x;
CREATE
httpd=> CREATE TABLE a (b text) INHERITS(z);
CREATE
httpd=> INSERT INTO x VALUES ('foo');
INSERT 168602 1
httpd=> select * from z*;
y  
---
foo
foo
(2 rows)

How did we suddenly get two rows??

With current sources:

regression=> CREATE TABLE x (y text);
CREATE
regression=> CREATE VIEW z AS select * from x;
CREATE
regression=> INSERT INTO x VALUES ('foo');
INSERT 411635 1
regression=> INSERT INTO z VALUES ('bar');
INSERT 411636 1
regression=> select * from x;
y
---
foo
(1 row)

regression=> select * from z;
y
---
foo
(1 row)

OK, where'd tuple 411636 go?  Seems to me that the insert should either
have been rejected or caused an insert into x, depending on how
transparent you think views are (I always thought they were
read-only?).  Dropping the data into never-never land and giving a
misleading success response code is not my idea of proper behavior.
