<HR> <H2> Section 1:	General Questions</H2> <H3><a
name="1.1">1.1</a>)	What is PostgreSQL?</H3>

<P>
PostgreSQL is an enhancement of the POSTGRES database management system,
a next-generation DBMS research prototype.  While PostgreSQL retains the
powerful data model and rich data types of POSTGRES, it replaces the
PostQuel query language with an extended subset of SQL.  PostgreSQL is
free and the complete source is available.
<P>
PostgreSQL development is being performed by a team of Internet
developers who all subscribe to the PostgreSQL development mailing list.
The current coordinator is Marc G. Fournier (<a
href="mailto:scrappy@postgreSQL.org">scrappy@postgreSQL.org</a>). (See
below on how to join). This team is now responsible for all current and
future development of PostgreSQL.
<P>
The authors of PostgreSQL 1.01 were Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen. Many
others have contributed to the porting, testing, debugging and
enhancement of the code.  The original Postgres code, from which
PostgreSQL is derived, was the effort of many graduate students,
undergraduate students, and staff programmers working under the
direction of Professor Michael Stonebraker at the University of
California, Berkeley.
<P>
The original name of the software at Berkeley was Postgres.  When SQL
functionality was added in 1995, its name was changed to Postgres95. The
name was changed at the end of 1996 to PostgreSQL.
<P>
<H3><a name="1.2">1.2</a>)	What does PostgreSQL run
on?</H3>
<P>
The authors have compiled and tested PostgreSQL on the following
platforms(some of these compiles require gcc 2.7.0):
<UL>
<LI>   aix -            IBM on AIX 3.2.5
<LI>   alpha -          DEC Alpha AXP on OSF/1 2.0

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3><a name="1.6">1.6</a>)	Latest release of PostgreSQL</H3>
<P>
The latest release of PostgreSQL is version 6.0, which was released on
January 31, 1997.  6.1 is scheduled for release soon.  For information
about what is new in 6.1, see our TODO list on our WWW page.
<P>
We expect a 7.0 release in several months that will remove time-travel
and reduce by 50% the size of on-disk system columns maintained for each
row in a table.  This release will also require a dump and restore.
<P>
<H3><a name="1.7">1.7</a>)	Is there a commercial version of PostgreSQL?</H3>
<P>
Illustra Information Technology (a wholly owned subsidiary of Informix
Software, Inc.) sells an object-relational DBMS called Illustra that was
originally based on postgres. Illustra has cosmetic similarities to
PostgreSQL but has more features, is more robust, performs better, and
offers real documentation and support.  On the flip side, it costs
money. For more information, contact <a
href="mailto:sales@illustra.com">sales@illustra.com</a>
<P>
<H3><a name="1.8">1.8</a>)	What documentation is available for PostgreSQL?</H3>
<P>
A user manual, manual pages, and some small test examples are included
in the distribution.  The sql and built-in manual pages are particularly
important.
<P>
The www page contains pointers to an implementation guide and five
papers written about postgres design concepts and features.
<P>
<H3><a name="1.9">1.9</a>)	What version of SQL does PostgreSQL use?</H3>
<P>
PostgreSQL supports a subset of SQL-92.  It has most of the important
constructs but lacks some of the functionality. The most visible
differences are:
<UL>
<LI> no support for nested subqueries
<LI> no HAVING clause under a GROUP BY
</UL>
<P>
On the other hand, you get to create user-defined types, functions,
inheritance etc.  If you're willing to help with PostgreSQL coding,
eventually we can also add the missing features listed above.
<P>
<H3><a name="1.10">1.10</a>)	Does PostgreSQL work with databases from
earlier versions of postgres?</H3>
<P>
PostgreSQL v1.09 is compatible with databases created with v1.01. Those
upgrading from 1.0 should read the directions in the
MIGRATION_1.0_TO_1.02 directory.
<P>
Upgrading to 6.0 requires a dump and restore from previous releases.
<P>
Upgrading to 6.1 requires a dump and restore from previous releases.
<P>
Those ugrading from versions earlier than 1.09 must upgrade to 1.09
first without a dump/reload, then dump the data from 1.09, and then load
it into 6.0 or 6.1.
<P>
<H3><a name="1.11">1.11</a>)	How many people use PostgreSQL?</H3>
<P>
Since we don't have any licensing or registration scheme, it's
impossible to tell.  We do know hundreds copies of PostgreSQL  v1.* have
been downloaded, and that there many hundreds of  subscribers to the
mailing lists.

<H2> Section 2:	Installation Questions
</H2>
<P>
<H3><a name="2.1">2.1</a>)	initdb doesn't run</H3>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> check to see that you have the proper paths set
<LI> check that the 'postgres' user owns all the right files
<LI> ensure that there are files in $PGDATA/files, and that they
are non-empty.  If they aren't, then "gmake install" failed for
some reason
</UL>
<P>
<H3><a name="2.2">2.2</a>)	when I start up the postmaster, I get
		"FindBackend: could not find a backend to execute..."
		"postmaster: could not find backend to execute..."</H3>
<P>
You probably do not have the right path set up. The 'postgres'
executable needs to be in your path.
<P>
<H3><a name="2.3">2.3</a>)	The system seems to be confused about commas,
decimal points, and date formats.</H3>
<P>
Check your locale configuration. PostgreSQL uses the locale settings of
the user that ran the postmaster process.  Set those accordingly for
your operating environment.
<P>
<H3><a name="2.4">2.4</a>)	How do I install PostgreSQL somewhere other than
/usr/local/pgsql?</H3>
<P>
You need to edit Makefile.global and change POSTGRESDIR accordingly, or
create a Makefile.custom and define POSTGRESDIR there.
<P>
<H3><a name="2.5">2.5</a>)	When I run postmaster, I get a Bad System
Call core dumped message.</H3>
<P>
It could be a variety of problems, but first check to see that you have
system V extensions installed on your kernel. PostgreSQL requires kernel
support for shared memory.
<P>
<H3><a name="2.6">2.6</a>)	When I try to start the postmaster, I get
IpcMemoryCreate errors.</H3>
<P>
You either do not have shared memory configured properly in kernel or
you need to enlarge the shared memory available in the kernel.  The
exact amount you need depends on your architecture  and how many buffers
you configure postmaster to run with.   For most systems, with default
buffer sizes, you need a minimum of ~760K.
<P>
<H3><a name="2.7">2.7</a>)	I have changed a source file, but a
recompile does not see the change?</H3>
<P>
The Makefiles do not have the proper dependencies for include files. You
have to do a 'make clean' and then another 'make'.
<P>
<HR>
<H2> Section 3:	PostgreSQL Features
</H2>

<P>
<H3><a name="3.1">3.1</a>)	How do I specify a KEY or other constraints on a
column?</H3>
<P>
Column constraints are not supported in PostgreSQL. As a consequence,
the system does not check for duplicates.
<P>
Under 6.0, create a unique index on the column.  Attempts to create
duplicate of that column will report an error.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.2">3.2</a>)	Does PostgreSQL support nested subqueries?</H3>
<P>
Subqueries are not implemented, but they can be simulated using sql
functions.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.3">3.3</a>)	How do I define a unique indices?</H3>
<P>
PostgreSQL 6.0 supports unique indices.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.4">3.4</a>)	I've having a lot of problems using rules.</H3>
<P>
Currently, the rule system in PostgreSQL is mostly broken. It works
enough to support the view mechanism, but that's about it.  Use
PostgreSQL rules at your own peril.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.5">3.5</a>)	I can't seem to write into the middle of large
objects reliably.</H3>
<P>
The Inversion large object system in PostgreSQL is also mostly broken.
It works well enough for storing large wads of data and reading them
back out, but the implementation has some underlying problems.  Use
PostgreSQL large objects at your own peril.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.6">3.6</a>)	Does PostgreSQL have a graphical user interface?
A report generator? A embedded query language interface?</H3>
<P>
No. No. No.  Not in the official distribution at least. Some users have
reported some success at using 'pgbrowse' and 'onyx' as frontends to
PostgreSQL.  Several contributions are working on tk based frontend
tools.  Ask on the mailing list.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.7">3.7</a>)	How can I write client applications to PostgreSQL?</H3>
<P>
PostgreSQL supports a C-callable library interface called libpq as well
as a Tcl-based library interface called libtcl.
<P>
Others have contributed a perl interface and a WWW gateway to
PostgreSQL.  See the PostgreSQL home pages for more details.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.8">3.8</a>)	How do I prevent other hosts from accessing my
PostgreSQL backend?</H3>
<P>
Use host-based authentication by modifying the file $PGDATA/pg_hba
accordingly.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.9">3.9</a>)	How do I set up a pg_group?</H3>
<P>
Currently, there is no easy interface to set up user groups. You have to
explicitly insert/update the pg_group table. For example:
<PRE>
<CODE>
	jolly=&gt; insert into pg_group (groname, grosysid, grolist)
	jolly=&gt;     values ('posthackers', '1234', '{5443, 8261}');
	INSERT 548224
	jolly=&gt; grant insert on foo to group posthackers;
	CHANGE
	jolly=&gt;
</CODE>
</PRE>
<P>
	The fields in pg_group are:
<UL>
<LI> groname:  the group name.  This a char16 and should
			  be purely alphanumeric.  Do not include underscores
			  or other punctuation.
<LI>		grosysid: the group id.  This is an int4.
			  This should be unique for each group.
<LI>		grolist:   the list of pg_user id's that belong in the group.
			  This is an int4[].
</UL>
<P>
<H3><a name="3.10">3.10</a>)	What is the exact difference between binary
cursors and normal cursors?</H3>
<P>
Normal cursors return data back in ASCII format.  Since data is stored
natively in binary format, the system must do a conversion to produce
the ASCII format.  In addition, ASCII formats are often large in size
than binary format.  Once the attributes come back in ASCII, often the
client application then has to convert it to a binary format to
manipulate it anyway.
<P>
Binary cursors give you back the data in the native binary
representation.  Thus, binary cursors will tend to be a little faster
since there's less overhead of conversion.
<P>
However, ASCII is architectural neutral whereas binary representation
can differ between different machine architecture.  Thus, if your client
machine uses a different representation than you server machine, getting
back attributes in binary format is probably not what you want. Also, if
your main purpose is displaying the data in ASCII, then getting it back
in ASCII will save you some effort on the client side.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.11">3.11</a>)	Why doesn't the != operator work?</H3>
<P>
SQL specifies &lt;&gt; as the inequality operator, and that is what we
have defined for the built-in types.
<P>
In 6.0, != is equivalent to &lt;&gt;.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.12">3.12</a>)	What is a R-tree index and what is it used for?</H3>
<P>
An r-tree index is used for indexing spatial data. A hash index can't
handle range searches. A B-tree index only handles range searches in a
single dimension. R-tree's can handle multi-dimensional data.  For
example, if a R-tree index can be built on an attribute of type 'point',
the system can more efficient answer queries like select all points
within a bounding rectangle.
<P>
The canonical paper that describes the original R-Tree design is:
<P>
Guttman, A. "R-Trees: A Dynamic Index Structure for Spatial Searching."
Proc of the 1984 ACM SIGMOD Int'l Conf on Mgmt of Data, 45-57.
<P>

<H3><a name="3.13">3.13</a>)	What is the maximum size for a tuple?</H3>
<P>
Tuples are limited to 8K bytes.  Taking into account system attributes
and other overhead, one should stay well shy of 8,000 bytes to be on the
safe side.   To use attributes larger than 8K, try using the large
objects interface.
<P>
Tuples do not cross 8k boundaries so a 5k tuple will require 8k of
storage.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.14">3.14</a>)	I defined indices but my queries don't seem
to make use of them. Why?</H3>
<P>
PostgreSQL does not automatically maintain statistics.  One has to make
an explicit 'vacuum' call to update the statistics.   After statistics
are updated, the optimizer has a better shot at using indices.  Note
that the optimizer is limited and does not use indices in some
circumstances (such as OR clauses).
<P>
If the system still does not see the index, it is probably because you
have created an index on a field with the improper *_ops type.  For
example, you have created a CHAR(4) field, but have specified a char_ops
index type_class.
<P>
See the create_index manual page for information on what type classes
are available.  It must match the field type.
<P>
Postgres does not warn the user when the improper index is created.
<P>
Indexes not used for ORDER BY operations.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.15">3.15</a>)	Are there ODBC drivers for PostgreSQL?</H3>
<P>
There are two ODBC drivers available, PostODBC and OpenLink ODBC.
<P>
For all people being interested in PostODBC, there are now two mailing
lists devoted to the discussion of PostODBC. The mailing lists are:
<UL>
<LI> <a
href="mailto:postodbc-users@listserv.direct.net">postodbc-users@listserv.direct.
net</a>
<LI> <a
href="mailto:postodbc-developers@listserv.direct.net">postodbc-developers@listse
rv.direct.net</a>
</UL>
<P>
these lists are ordinary majordomo mailing lists.  You can subscribe by
sending a mail to:
<UL>
<LI>	        <a
href="mailto:majordomo@listserv.direct.net">majordomo@listserv.direct.net</a>
</UL>
<P>
OpenLink ODBC is currently in beta under Linux. You can get it from <a
href="http://www.openlinksw.com/postgres.html">
http://www.openlinksw.com/postgres.html</a>. It works with our standard
ODBC client software so you'll have Postgres ODBC available on every
client platform we support (Win, Mac, Unix, VMS).
<P>
We will probably be selling this product to people who need
commercial-quality support, but a freeware version will always be
available. Questions to <a
href="mailto:postgres95@openlink.co.uk">postgres95@openlink.co.uk</a>.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.16">3.16</a>)	How do I use postgres for multi-dimensional
indexing (&gt; 2 dimensions)?</H3>
<P>
Builtin R-Trees can handle polygons and boxes.  In theory, R-trees can
be extended to handle higher number of dimensions.  In practice,
extending R-trees require a bit of work and we don't currently have any
documentation on how to do it.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.17">3.17</a>)	How do I do regular expression searches?
case-insensitive regexp searching?</H3>
<P>
PostgreSQL supports the SQL LIKE syntax as well as more general regular
expression searching with the ~ operator. The !~ is the negated regexp
operator.  ~* and !~* are the case-insensitive regular expression
operators.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.18">3.18</a>)	I can't access the database as the 'root' user.</H3>
<P>
You should not create database users with user id 0(root). They will  be
unable to access the database.  This is a security precaution  because
of the ability of any user to dynamically link object modules  into the
database engine.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.19">3.19</a>)	I experienced a server crash during a
vacuum.  How do I remove the lock file?</H3>
<P>
If the server crashes during a vacuum command, chances are it will leave
a lock file hanging around.  Attempts to re-run the vacuum command
result in
<PRE>
<SAMP>
	WARN:can't create lock file -- another vacuum cleaner running?
</SAMP>
</PRE>
<P>
If you are sure that no vacuum is actually running, you can remove the
file called "pg_vlock" in your database directory (which is
$PGDATA/base/&lt;dbName&gt;)
<P>
<H3><a name="3.20">3.20</a>)	What is the difference between the various
character types?</H3>
<PRE>
Type            Internal Name   Notes
--------------------------------------------------
CHAR            char            1 character   }
CHAR2           char2           2 characters  }
CHAR4           char4           4 characters  } optimized for a fixed length
CHAR8           char8           8 characters  }
CHAR16          char16          16 characters }
CHAR(#)         bpchar          blank padded to the specified fixed length
VARCHAR(#)      varchar         size specifies maximum length, no padding
TEXT            text            length limited only by maximum tuple length
BYTEA           bytea           variable-length array of bytes
</PRE>
<P>
Remember, you need to use the internal name when creating indexes on
these fields or when doing other internal operations.
<P>
The last four types above are "varlena" types (i.e. the first four bytes
is the length, followed by the data). CHAR(#) and VARCHAR(#) allocate
the maximum number of bytes no matter how much data is stored in the
field.  TEXT and BYTEA are the only character types that have variable
length on the disk.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.21">3.21</a>)	In a query, how do I detect if a field is NULL?</H3>
<P>
PostgreSQL has two builtin keywords, "isnull" and "notnull" (note no
spaces).  Version 1.05 and later and 6.* understand IS NULL and IS NOT
NULL.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.22">3.22</a>)	How do I see how the query optimizer is
evaluating my query?</H3>
<P>
Place the word 'EXPLAIN' at the beginning of the query, for example:
<PRE>
<CODE>
	EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age = 23;
</CODE>
</PRE>
<P>
<H3><a name="3.23">3.23</a>)	How do I create a serial field?</H3>
<P>
Postgres does not allow the user to specifiy a user column as type
SERIAL.  Instead, you can use each row's oid field as a unique value. 
However, if you need to dump and reload the database, you need to be
using postgres version 1.07 or later or 6.* with pgdump's -o option or
COPY's WITH OIDS option to preserver the oids.
<P>
Another valid way of doing this is to create a function:
<PRE>
<CODE>
	create table my_oids (f1 int4);
	insert into my_oids values (1);
	create function new_oid () returns int4 as
		'update my_oids set f1 = f1 + 1;  select f1 from my_oids; '
	language 'sql';
</CODE>
</PRE>
<P>
then:
<PRE>
<CODE>
       	create table my_stuff (my_key int4, value text);
	insert into my_stuff values (new_oid(), 'hello');
</CODE>
</PRE>
<P>
However, keep in mind there is a race condition here where one server
could do the update, then another one do an update, and they both could
select the same new id.  This statement should be performed within a
transaction.
<P>
Sequences are implemented in 6.1
<P>
<H3><a name="3.24">3.24</a>)	How do I create a multi-column index?</H3>
<P>

In 6.0, you can not directly create a multi-column index using create
index.  You need to define a function which acts on the multiple columns,
then use create index with that function.
<P>
In 6.1, this feature is available.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.25">3.25</a>)	What are the temp_XXX files in my database
directory?</H3>
<P>
They are temp_ files generated by the query executor.  For example, if a
sort needs to be done to satisfy an ORDER BY, some temp files are
generated as a result of the sort.
<P>
If you have no transactions or sorts running at the time, it is safe to
delete the temp_ files.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.26">3.26</a>)	Why are my table files not getting any
smaller after a delete?</H3>
<P>
If you run vacuum in pre-6.0, unused rows will be marked for reuse, but
the file blocks are not released.
<P>
In 6.0, vacuum properly shrinks tables.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.27">3.27</a>)	Why can't I connect to my database from
another machine?</H3>
<P>
The default configuration allows only connections from tcp/ip host
localhost.  You need to add a host entry to the file pgsql/data/pg_hba.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.28">3.28</a>)	I get the error 'default index class
unsupported' when creating an index.  How do I do it?</H3>
<P>
You probably used:
<PRE>
<CODE>
	create index idx1 on person using btree (name);
</CODE>
</PRE>
<P>
PostgreSQL indexes are extensible, and therefore in pre-6.0, you must
specify a class_type when creating an index.  Read the manual page for
create index (called create_index).
<P>
Version 6.0, if you do not specify a class_type, it defaults to the
proper type for the column.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.29">3.29</a>)	Why does creating an index crash the
backend server?</H3>
<P>
You have probably defined an incorrect *_ops type class for the field
you are indexing.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.30">3.30</a>)	How do I find out what indexes or
operations are defined in the database?</H3>
<P>
Run the file pgsql/src/tutorial/syscat.source.  It illustrates many of
the 'select's needed to get information out of the database system
tables.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.31">3.31</a>) 	Why do statements require an extra character at
the end?  Why does 'createuser' return 'unexpected last match in input()'?
Why does pg_dump fail?</H3>
<P>
You have compile postgres with flex version 2.5.3.  There is bug in this
version of flex.  Use flex version 2.5.2 or flex 2.5.4 instead.  There
is a doc/README.flex file which will properly patch the flex 2.5.3
source code.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.32">3.32</a>)	All my servers crash under concurrent table
access.  Why?</H3>
<P>
This problem can be caused by a kernel that is not configured to support
semaphores.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.33">3.33</a>)	What tools are available for hooking
postgres to Web pages?</H3>
<P>
For web integration, PHP/FI is an excellent interface. The URL for that
is <a href="http://www.vex.net/php/">http://www.vex.net/php/</a>
<P>
PHP is great for simple stuff, but for more complex stuff, some still
use the perl interface and CGI.pm.

<H3><a name="3.34">3.34</a>)	What is the time-warp feature and how does
it relate to vacuum?</H3>
<P>
PostgreSQL handles data changes differently than most database systems.
When a row is changed in a table, the original row is marked with the
time it was changed, and a new row is created with the current data.  By
default, only current rows are used in a table.  If you specify a
date/time after the table name in a FROM clause, you can access the data
that was current at that time, i.e.
<PRE>
<CODE>
	SELECT *
	FROM employees ['July 24, 1996 09:00:00']
</CODE>
</PRE>
<P>
displays employee rows in the table at the specified time. You can
specify intervals like [date,date], [date,], [,date], or [,].  This last
option accesses all rows that ever existed.
<P>
INSERTed rows get a timestamp too, so rows that were not in the table at
the desired time will not appear.
<P>
Vacuum removes rows that are no longer current.  This time-warp feature
is used by the engine for rollback and crash recovery.  Expiration times
can be set with purge.
<P>
In 6.0, once a table is vacuumed, the creation time of a row may be
incorrect, causing time-traval to fail.
<P>
The time-travel feature will be removed in 7.0.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.35">3.35</a>)	How do I tune the database engine for
better performance?</H3>
<P>
There are two things that can be done.  You can use Openlink's option to
disable fsync() by starting the postmaster with a  '-o -F' option.  This
will prevent fsync()'s from flushing to disk after every transaction.
<P>
You can also use the postmaster -B option to increase the number of
shared memory buffers shared among the backend processes.  If you make
this parameter too high, the process will not start or crash
unexpectedly.  Each buffer is 8K and the defualt is 64 buffers.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.36">3.36</a>)	What debugging features are available in
PostgreSQL?</H3>
<P>
PostgreSQL has several features that report status information that can
be valuable for debugging purposes.
<P>
First, by compiling with DEBUG defined, many assert()'s monitor the
progress of the backend and halt the program when something unexpected
occurs.
<P>
Both postmaster and postgres have several debug options available.
First, whenever you start the postmaster, make sure you send the
standard output and error to a log file, like:
<PRE>
<KBD>
	cd /usr/local/pgsql
	./bin/postmaster &gt;server.log 2&gt;&1 &
</KBD>
</PRE>
<P>
This will put a server.log file in the top-level PostgreSQL directory.
This file can contain useful information about problems or errors
encountered by the server.  Postmaster has a -d option that allows even
more detailed information to be reported.  The -d option takes a number
1-3 that specifies the debug level.  The query plans in a verbose debug
file can be formatted using the 'indent' program. (You may need to
remove the '====' lines in 1.* releases.) Be warned that a debug level
greater than one generates large  log files in 1.* releases.
<P>
You can actuall run the postgres backend from the command line, and type
your SQL statement directly.  This is recommended ONLY for debugging
purposes. Note that a newline terminates the query, not a semicolon.  If
you have compiled with debugging symbols, you can perhaps use a debugger
to see what is happening.  Because the backend was not started from the
postmaster, it is not running in an identical environment and
locking/backend interaction problems may not be duplicated.  Some
operating system can attach to a running backend directly to diagnose
problems.
<P>
The postgres program has a -s, -A, -t options that can be very usefull
for debugging and performance measurements.
<P>
The EXPLAIN command (see this FAQ) allows you to see how PostgreSQL is
iterpreting your query.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.37">3.37</a>)	What is an oid?  What is a tid?</H3>
<P>
Oids are Postgres's answer to unique row ids or serial columns.  Every
row that is created in Postgres gets a unique oid.  All oids generated
by initdb are less than 16384 (from backend/access/transam.h).  All
post-initdb (user-created) oids are equal or greater that this.  All
these oids are unique not only within a table, or database, but unique
within the entire postgres installation.
<P>
Postgres uses oids in its internal system tables to link rows in
separate tables.  These oids can be used to identify specific user rows
and used in joins.  It is recommended you use column type oid to store
oid values.  See the sql(l) manual page to see the other internal
columns.
<P>
Tids are used to indentify specific physical rows with block and offset
values.  Tids change after rows are modified or reloaded.  They are used
by index entries to point to physical rows.  They can not be accessed
through sql.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.38">3.38</a>)	What is the meaning of some of the terms
used in Postgres?</H3>
<P>
Some of the source code and older documentation use terms that have more
common usage.  Here are some:
<UL>
<LI> row, record, tuple
<LI> attribute, field, column
<LI> table, class
<LI> retrieve, select
<LI> replace, update
<LI> append, insert
<LI> oid, serial value
<LI> portal, cursor
<LI> range variable, table name, table alias
</UL>
<P>
Please let me know if you think of any more.
<P>
<H3><a name="3.39">3.39</a>)	What is Genetic Query Optimization?</H3>
<P>
The GEQO module in PostgreSQL is intended to solve the query
optimization problem of joining many tables by means of a Genetic
Algorithm (GA). It allows the handling of large join queries through
non-exhaustive search.
<P>
For further information see README.GEQO &lt;utesch@aut.tu-freiberg.de&gt;.

<H3><a name="4.1">4.1</a>)	I wrote a user-defined function and when I run it
in psql, it dumps core.</H3>
<P>
The problem could be a number of things.  Try testing your user-defined
function in a stand alone test program first. Also, make sure you are
not sending elog NOTICES when the front-end is expecting data, such as
during a type_in() or type_out() functions
<P>
<H3><a name="4.2">4.2</a>)	I get messages of the type
	NOTICE:PortalHeapMemoryFree: 0x402251d0 not in alloc set!</H3>
<P>
You are pfree'ing something that was not palloc'ed.  When writing
user-defined functions, do not include the file "libpq-fe.h".  Doing so
will cause your palloc to be a malloc instead of a free.  Then, when the
backend pfrees the storage, you get the notice message.
