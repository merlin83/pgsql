<H1>1.  INTRODUCTION</H1>
<HR>
     This document is the user  manual  for  the  
     <A HREF="http://s2k-ftp.cs.berkeley.edu:8000/postgres95/"><B>POSTGRES95</B></A>
     database  management system developed at the University
     of California at  Berkeley.   <B>POSTGRES95</B>  is  based  on
     <A HREF="http://s2k-ftp.CS.Berkeley.EDU:8000/postgres/postgres.html">
     <B>POSTGRES release 4.2</B></A>. The POSTGRES project, 
     led by Professor Michael Stonebraker, has been sponsored  by  the
     Defense  Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the
     Army Research Office (ARO), the National Science  
     Foundation (NSF), and ESL, Inc.
<H2>1.1.  What is POSTGRES?</H2>
     Traditional   relational  database  management  systems
     (DBMSs) support a data model consisting of a collection
     of named relations, containing attributes of a specific
     type.  In current commercial  systems,  possible  types
     include  floating  point  numbers,  integers, character
     strings, money, and dates.  It is  commonly  recognized
     that  this model is inadequate for future data 
     processing applications.
     The relational  model  successfully  replaced  previous
     models  in  part  because  of its "Spartan simplicity".
     However, as mentioned, this simplicity often makes  the
     implementation  of  certain applications very difficult
     to implement.  POSTGRES offers  substantial  additional
     power  by  incorporating  the following four additional
     basic constructs in such a way that  users  can  easily
     extend the system:
<p>
<PRE>         classes
         inheritance
         types
         functions
</PRE><p>
     In  addition,  POSTGRES  supports a powerful production
     rule system.
     
<H2><A NAME="a-short-history-of-the-postgres-project">1.2.  A Short History of the POSTGRES Project</A></H2>
     Implementation of the POSTGRES DBMS began in 1986.  The
     initial  concepts  for  the  system  were  presented in
     <A HREF="refs.html#STON86">[STON86]</A> and the definition of the initial  data  model
     appeared in <A HREF="refs.html#ROW87">[ROWE87]</A>.  The design of the rule system at
     that time was described in  <A HREF="refs.html#STON87a">[STON87a]</A>.   The  rationale
     and  architecture  of the storage manager were detailed
     in <A HREF="refs.html#STON87b">[STON87b]</A>.
     POSTGRES has undergone  several  major  releases  since
     then.   The  first "demoware" system became operational
     in 1987 and was shown at the  1988  <B>ACM-SIGMOD</B>  
     Conference.   We  released Version 1, described in <A HREF="refs.html#STON90a">[STON90a]</A>,
     to a few external users in June 1989.  In response to a
     critique  of  the  first rule system <A HREF="refs.html#STON89">[STON89]</A>, the rule
     system was  redesigned  <A HREF="refs.html#STON90">[STON90b]</A>  and  Version  2  was
     released  in  June 1990 with the new rule system.  
     Version 3 appeared in 1991 and added support for  multiple
     storage  managers,  an  improved  query executor, and a
     rewritten rewrite rule  system.   For  the  most  part,
     releases  since  then  have  focused on portability and
     reliability.
     POSTGRES has been  used  to  implement  many  different
     research and production applications.  These include: a
     financial data analysis system, a  jet  engine  
     performance   monitoring   package,   an   asteroid  tracking
     database, a medical information database,  and  several
     geographic information systems.  POSTGRES has also been
     used as an educational tool  at  several  universities.
     Finally,  <A HREF="http://www.illustra.com/">Illustra  Information  Technologies</A> picked up
     the code and commercialized it.
     POSTGRES  became  the  primary  data  manager  for  the
     <A HREF="http://www.sdsc.edu/0/Parts_Collabs/S2K/s2k_home.html">Sequoia 2000</A> scientific computing project in late 1992.
     Furthermore, the size of the  external  user  community
     nearly  doubled  during  1993.   It became increasingly
     obvious that maintenance of the prototype code and 
     support  was  taking  up large amounts of time that should
     have been devoted to database research.  In  an  effort
     to  reduce  this support burden, the project officially
     ended with <B>Version 4.2</B>.
     
<H2><A NAME="what-is-postgres95">1.3.  What is <B>POSTGRES95</B>?</A></H2>
     <B>POSTGRES95</B> is a derivative of the last official release
     of  POSTGRES  (version 4.2). The code is now completely
     ANSI C and the code size has been trimmed by 25&#37;. There
     are  a lot of internal changes that improve performance
     and code maintainability. <B>POSTGRES95</B> runs about  30-50&#37;
     faster  on  the  Wisconsin  Benchmark compared to v4.2.
     Apart from bug fixes, these are the major enhancements:
<UL>
      	<LI>The  query  language <B>POSTQUEL</B> has been replaced with
        	<B>SQL</B> (implemented in the server). We do  not  support
        	subqueries  (which can be imitated with user defined
        	<B>SQL</B> functions) at the moment. Aggregates  have  been
        	re-implemented.  We also added support for <B>GROUP BY</B>.
        	The <B>libpq</B> interface is still available  for  <B>C</B>  
        	programs.
      	<LI>In addition to the monitor program, we provide a new
        	program (<B>psql</B>) which supports <B>GNU</B> <B>readline</B>.
      	<LI>We added a new  front-end  library,  <B>libpgtcl</B>,  that
        	supports  <B>Tcl</B>-based  clients.   A sample shell, 
        	pgtclsh, provides new Tcl  commands  to  interface  <B>tcl</B>
        	programs with the <B>POSTGRES95</B> backend.
      	<LI>The  large  object interface has been overhauled. We
        	kept Inversion large objects as the  only  mechanism
        	for  storing  large objects. (This is not to be 
        	confused with the Inversion file system which has  been
        	removed.)
      	<LI>The  instance-level  rule  system  has been removed.
        	<LI>Rules are still available as rewrite rules.
      	<LI>A short tutorial introducing regular <B>SQL</B> features as
        	well as those of ours is distributed with the source
        	code.
      	<LI><B>GNU</B> make (instead of  <B>BSD</B>  make)  is  used  for  the
        	build.  Also,  <B>POSTGRES95</B>  can  be  compiled with an
        	unpatched <B>gcc</B> (data alignment of  doubles  has  been
        	fixed).

<H2><A NAME="outline-of-this-manual">1.5.  Outline of This Manual</A></H2>
     From  now  on, We will use POSTGRES to mean <B>POSTGRES95</B>.
     The first part of this manual goes over some basic sys-
     tem  concepts  and procedures for starting the POSTGRES
     system.  We then turn to a  tutorial  overview  of  the
     POSTGRES data model and SQL query language, introducing
     a few of its advanced features.  Next, we  explain  the
     POSTGRES  approach  to  extensibility  and describe how
     users can extend POSTGRES by adding user-defined types,
     operators, aggregates, and both query language and pro-
     gramming language functions.  After an extremely  brief
     overview  of  the POSTGRES rule system, the manual 
     concludes with a detailed appendix that discusses some  of
     the  more involved and operating system-specific 
     procedures involved in extending the system.
