<H1>10.  EXTENDING SQL: AGGREGATES</H1>
<HR>
     Aggregates  in POSTGRES are expressed in terms of state
     transition functions.  That is,  an  aggregate  can  be
     defined  in terms of state that is modified whenever an
     instance is processed.  Some state functions look at  a
     particular value in the instance when computing the new
     state (<B>sfunc1</B> in the  create  aggregate  syntax)  while
     others  only  keep  track  of  their own internal state
     (<B>sfunc2</B>).
     If we define an aggregate that  uses  only  <B>sfunc1</B>,  we
     define an aggregate that computes a running function of
     the attribute values from each instance.  "Sum"  is  an
     example  of  this  kind  of aggregate.  "Sum" starts at
     zero and always adds the current  instance's  value  to
     its  running  total.   We  will  use the <B>int4pl</B> that is
     built into POSTGRES to perform this addition.
     
<pre>         CREATE AGGREGATE complex_sum (
              sfunc1 = complex_add,
              basetype = complex,
              stype1 = complex,
              initcond1 = '(0,0)'
           );


         SELECT complex_sum(a) FROM test_complex;


         +------------+
         |complex_sum |
         +------------+
         |(34,53.9)   |
         +------------+
</pre>

     If we define only <B>sfunc2</B>, we are specifying  an  aggregate  
     that computes a running function that is independent  of  
     the  attribute  values  from  each  instance.
     "Count"  is  the  most  common  example of this kind of
     aggregate.  "Count" starts at zero and adds one to  its
     running  total for each instance, ignoring the instance
     value.  Here, we use the built-in <B>int4inc</B> routine to do
     the work for us.  This routine increments (adds one to)
     its argument.
     
<pre>         CREATE AGGREGATE my_count (sfunc2 = int4inc, -- add one
                                      basetype = int4, stype2 = int4,
                                      initcond2 = '0')

         SELECT my_count(&#42;) as emp_count from EMP;


         +----------+
         |emp_count |
         +----------+
         |5         |
         +----------+
</pre>
         
     "Average" is an example of an aggregate  that  requires
     both  a function to compute the running sum and a function 
     to compute the running count.   When  all  of  the
     instances have been processed, the final answer for the
     aggregate is the running sum  divided  by  the  running
     count.   We use the <B>int4pl</B> and <B>int4inc</B> routines we used
     before as well as the POSTGRES  integer  division  
     routine,  <B>int4div</B>,  to  compute the division of the sum by
     the count.
     
<pre>         CREATE AGGREGATE my_average (sfunc1 = int4pl, --  sum
                                        basetype = int4,
                                        stype1 = int4,
                                        sfunc2 = int4inc, -- count
                                        stype2 = int4,
                                        finalfunc = int4div, -- division
                                        initcond1 = '0',
                                        initcond2 = '0')

         SELECT my_average(salary) as emp_average FROM EMP;


         +------------+
         |emp_average |
         +------------+
         |1640        |
         +------------+
