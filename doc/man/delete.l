.BR Delete
removes instances which satisfy the qualification,

from the class specified by
.IR instance_variable .
.IR Instance_variable
is either a class name or a variable assigned by

If the qualification is absent, the effect is to delete all instances
in the class.  The result is a valid, but empty class.

as read access to any class whose values are read in the qualification
(see
.IR "change acl" (l).
