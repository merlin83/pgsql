.SH NAME
\&.../src/backend/obj/{local,dbdb}.bki \(em template scripts
.SH DESCRIPTION
Backend Interface (BKI) files are scripts that describe the contents
of the initial Postgres database.  This database is constructed during
system installation, by the
.IR initdb
command.
.IR Initdb
executes the Postgres backend with a special set of flags, that cause it
to consume the BKI scripts and bootstrap a database.
.PP
These files are automatically generated from system header files
during installation.  They are not intended for use by humans, and you
do not need to understand their contents in order to use Postgres.  These
files are copied to
.nf
\&.../files/{global1,local1_XXX}.bki
.fi
during system installation.
.PP
All new user databases will be created by copying the template
database that Postgres constructs from the BKI files.  Thus, a simple way
to customize the template database is to let the Postgres initialization
script create it for you, and then to run the terminal monitor to make
the changes you want.
.PP
The Postgres backend interprets BKI files as described below.  This
description will be easier to understand if the example in
\*(lq.../files/global1.bki\*(rq is at hand.
.PP
Commands are composed of a command name followed by space separated
arguments.  Arguments to a command which begin with a \*(lq$\*(rq are
treated specially.  If \*(lq$$\*(rq are the first two characters, then
the first \*(lq$\*(rq is ignored and the argument is then processed
normally.  If the \*(lq$\*(rq is followed by space, then it is treated
as a
.SM NULL
value.  Otherwise, the characters following the \*(lq$\*(rq are
interpreted as the name of a macro causing the argument to be replaced
with the macro's value.  It is an error for this macro to be
undefined.
.PP
Macros are defined using
.nf
define macro macro_name = macro_value
.fi
and are undefined using 
.nf
undefine macro macro_name
.fi
and redefined using the same syntax as define.
.PP
Lists of general commands and macro commands
follow.
.SH "GENERAL COMMANDS"
.TP 5n
.BR "open" " classname"
Open the class called
.IR classname
for further manipulation.
.TP
.BR "close" " [classname]"
Close the open class called
.IR classname.
It is an error if 
.IR classname
is not already opened.   If no
.IR classname
is given, then the currently open class is closed.
.TP
.BR print
Print the currently open class.
.TP
.BR "insert" " [oid=oid_value] " "(" " value1 value2 ... " ")"
Insert a new instance to the open class using
.IR value1 ,
.IR value2 ,
etc., for its attribute values and 
.IR oid_value
for its OID.  If
.IR oid_value
is not \*(lq0\*(rq, then this value will be used as the instance's
object identifier.  Otherwise, it is an error.
.TP
.BR "insert (" " value1 value2 ... " ")"
As above, but the system generates a unique object identifier.
.TP
.BR "create" " classname " "(" " name1 = type1, name2 = type2, ... " ")"
Create a class named
.IR classname
with the attributes given in parentheses.
.TP
.BR "open (" " name1 = type1, name2 = type2,... " ") as" " classname"
Open a class named
.IR classname
for writing but do not record its existence in the system catalogs.
(This is primarily to aid in bootstrapping.)
.TP
.BR "destroy" " classname"
Destroy the class named
.IR classname .
.TP
.BR "define index" " index-name " "on" " class-name " "using" " amname "
( opclass attr | function({attr}) )
.br
Create an index named
.IR index_name
on the class named
.IR classname
using the
.IR amname
access method.  The fields to index are called
.IR name1 ,
.IR name2 ,
etc., and the operator collections to use are
.IR collection_1 ,
.IR collection_2 ,
etc., respectively.
.SH "MACRO COMMANDS"
.TP
.BR "define function" " macro_name " "as" " rettype function_name ( args )"
Define a function prototype for a function named
.IR macro_name
which has its value of type
.IR rettype
computed from the execution
.IR function_name
with the arguments
.IR args 
declared in a C-like manner.
.TP
.BR "define macro" " macro_name " "from file" " filename"
Define a macro named
.IR macname
which has its value 
read from the file called
.IR filename .

.SH EXAMPLE
The following set of commands will create the \*(lqpg_opclass\*(rq
class containing the
.IR int_ops
collection as object
.IR 421,
print out the class, and then close it.
.nf
create pg_opclass (opcname=char16)
open pg_opclass
insert oid=421 (int_ops)
