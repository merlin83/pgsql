This FAQ covers issues that are specific for PostgreSQL running on Digital
Unix (formerly known as DEC OSF/1). Please check the global FAQ for questions
not specific to this platform.

Changes in this version (* = modified, + = new, - = removed):

This file is divided approximately as follows:

1.*)	Installing PostgreSQL

1.1.*)		Compiling PostgreSQL

1.2.*)		Running the regression tests


Questions answered:
1.1.1)	I can't compile PostgreSQL with gcc.

1.1.2)	DEC C dies with an internal error when optimization is
		enabled (-O flag).

1.2.1)	The regression tests fail for char, varchar, select_implicit,
		select_having and rules.

1.2.2)	The regression tests fail for abstime, tinterval and horology.

1.2.3)	The regression tests fail for geometry.

1.2.4)	The regression tests fail for inet.

Section 1.1:	Compiling PostgreSQL
------------------------------------

1.1.1)	I can't compile PostgreSQL with gcc.

		Me too O:-) I tried to compile it with gcc 2.7.2.1 without
		success. However, I've found that DEC C works much better than
		gcc for alphas, and so I didn't make any effort to find out
		why gcc fails. If you succedd on this task, please take the
		time to update this section (see http://www.postgresql.org for
		the details on how to do this).

1.1.2)	The DEC C compiler dies with an internal error when optimization is
		enabled (-O flag).

		I've seen this happening on 3.2c and 3.2g systems, and only on
		one of the source files (can't remember exactly which one).
		The workaround was to compile the offending module without
		optimization by hand, and re-running gmake to let the process
		continue.

		It doesn't happen on 4.0d systems (mine at least). Don't know
		about earlier 4.0 versions.

Section 1.2:	Running the regression tests
--------------------------------------------

1.2.1)	The regression tests fail for char, varchar, select_implicit,
		select_having and rules.

		This only happens when you enable locale support, and is due
		to a bug in the system's locale libraries. The problem is
		that strcoll("Axxx", "axxx") returns a value greater than
		zero instead of lower, which is how it should be.

		This isn't a great problem unless you (or your application)
		relies on upper-case letters being considered "smaller" than
		lower-case for ordering purposes. Otherwise, you will only
		notice that the ordering between upper-case and lower-case
		letters is reversed.

1.2.2)	The regression tests fail for abstime, tinterval and horology.

		I think that these failures are due to some inconsistencies
		in time zone handling in some years near 1950, in which case
		the problem would be in the operating system's time zone
		libraries. Recent dates seem to work as expected, but I can't
		assure it.

1.2.3)	The regression tests fail for geometry.

		These are (small) rounding errors that shouldn't affect any
		application (but could do, who knows).

1.2.4)	The regression tests fail for inet.

		Yes, they do. You must consider the inet type broken for
		Digital Unix.
