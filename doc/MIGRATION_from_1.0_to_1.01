The following notes are for the benefit of users who want to migrate
databases from postgres95 1.0 to postgres95 1.01.  

If you are starting afresh with postgres95 1.01 and do not need
to migrate old databases, you do not need to read any further.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to postgres95 version 1.01 with databases created with
postgres95 version 1.0, the following steps are required:  

1) Set the definition of NAMEDATALEN in src/Makefile.global to 16
   and OIDNAMELEN to 20.

2) Decide whether you want to use Host based authentication.  

   A) If you do, you must create a file name "pg_hba" in your top-level data
   directory (typically the value of your $PGDATA).  src/libpq/pg_hba
   shows an example syntax.

   B) If you do not want host-based authentication, you can comment out
   the line
	HBA = 1
   in src/Makefile.global

   Note that host-based authentication is turned on by default, and if
   you do not take steps A or B above, the out-of-the-box 1.01 will
   not allow you to connect to 1.0 databases.

3) compile and install 1.01, but DO NOT do the initdb step.

4) before doing anything else, terminate your 1.0 postmaster, and
   backup your existing $PGDATA directory.   

5) set your PGDATA environment variable to your 1.0 databases, but set up
   path up so that 1.01 binaries are being used.

6) modify the file $PGDATA/PG_VERSION from 5.0 to 5.1

7) start up a new 1.01 postmaster

5) Add the new built-in functions and operators of 1.01 to 1.0
   databases.  This is done by running the new 1.01 server against
   your own 1.0 database and applying the queries in the file
   1.0_to_1.01.sql.   This can be done easily through psql.  If your
   1.0 database is name "testdb":

	% psql testdb -f 1.0_to_1.01.sql
