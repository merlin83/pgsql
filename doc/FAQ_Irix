   The 6.3.2 man pages have been HTML-ized by Aleksey Dashevsky
   (lyolik@luckynet.co.il). We are currently transitioning to the
   SGML-based documentation mentioned above. However, the man pages may
   contain information not yet in the new documentation. In particular,
   the man pages for SQL commands and for programs such as psql contain
   the best available information for now. pod2html for the perl5
   interface is also current.
   
   The TODO List includes information on what has recently been completed
   and what we are planning on doing.
