This outlines how to increase the number of shared memory buffers
supported by BSD/OS.  By default, only 4MB of shared memory is supported
by BSDI.

Keep in mind that shared memory is not pageable.  It is locked in RAM.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Increase SHMMAXPGS by 1024 for every additional 4MB of shared
memory:

/sys/sys/shm.h:69:#define       SHMMAXPGS       1024    /* max hardware pages...

The default setting of 1024 is for a maximum of 4MB of shared memory.

For those running 4.1 or later, just recompile the kernel and reboot. 
For those running earlier releases, there are more steps outlined below.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use bpatch to find the sysptsize value for the current kernel. 
This is computed dynamically at bootup.

	$ bpatch -r sysptsize
	0x9 = 9

Next, change SYSPTSIZE to a hard-coded value.  Use the bpatch value,
plus add 1 for every additional 4MB of shared memory you desire.

/sys/i386/i386/i386_param.c:28:#define  SYSPTSIZE 0        /* dynamically...

sysptsize can not be changed by sysctl on the fly.
