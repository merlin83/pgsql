How do I installing PostgreSQL on Windows NT or Windows 2000?

1.  Install the Cygwin package.

    The Cygwin package provides a UNIX-like API on top of the Win32
    API.  It is available at <http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/>.  At
    the time of this writing, it is recommended to use either version
    1.1.7 or the 1.3.x series.  Version 1.1.8 contains a bug that will
    prevent the server to work.  Using older versions such as 1.0 or
    B20 might require extra efforts.

2.  Install the cygipc package, available at
    <http://www.neuro.gatech.edu/users/cwilson/cygutils/V1.1/cygipc/>.
    Do not use versions prior to 1.04, they will not work.

3.  Optional:  The "Andy Piper Tools" at <http://www.xemacs.freeserve.co.uk/>
    are a collection of pre-compiled libraries and utilities that you
    might find useful -- especially on Cygwin B20.

4.  The Cygwin bin directory has to be placed in the path before the
    Windows program directories, because the sort.exe has to be taken
    from Cygwin, not Windows.

5.  Start `ipc-daemon &' (background process) from the cygipc package.
    This program needs to be running anytime you start the PostgreSQL
    server (postmaster).

6.  Proceed according to the INSTALL file.  (./configure; make; etc.)

NOTE:  There are two issues with Cygwin's current UNIX domain socket
support:

1.  psql (and other clients) will hang if postmaster is not running and
    the socket file (e.g., /tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432) exists.

2.  Cygwin's AF_UNIX sockets are really implemented as AF_INET sockets
    so they are inherently insecure.

Problem reports can be sent to <pgsql-ports@postgresql.org>.
