How do I installing PostgreSQL on Windows NT or Windows 2000?

1.  Install the Cygwin package.

    The Cygwin package provides a UNIX-like API on top of the Win32
    API.  It is available at <http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/>.  At
    the time of this writing, it is recommended to use either version
    1.1.7, a snapshot built after 2001/02/05 12:36:41, or the 1.3.x series
    (when available).  Version 1.1.8 contains a bug that will prevent the
    server to work.  Using older versions such as 1.0 or B20 might require
    extra efforts.

2.  Install the cygipc package, available at
    <http://www.neuro.gatech.edu/users/cwilson/cygutils/V1.1/cygipc/>.
    Do not use versions prior to 1.04, they will not work.

3.  Optional:  The "Andy Piper Tools" at <http://www.xemacs.freeserve.co.uk/>
    are a collection of pre-compiled libraries and utilities that you
    might find useful -- especially on Cygwin B20.

4.  The Cygwin bin directory has to be placed in the path before the
    Windows program directories, because the sort.exe has to be taken
    from Cygwin, not Windows.

5.  Start ipc-daemon from the cygipc package.  Use "net start ipc-daemon",
    if ipc-daemon is installed as a service; otherwise, use "ipc-daemon &".
    This program needs to be running anytime you start the PostgreSQL
    server (postmaster).

6.  Proceed according to the INSTALL file.  (./configure; make; etc.)

NOTE:  The following are known issues with PostgreSQL on Windows:

1.  Cygwin's AF_UNIX sockets are really implemented as AF_INET sockets
    so they are inherently insecure.

2.  make check can generate spurious regression test failures due to
    overflowing the the listen() backlog queue which causes connection
    refused errors.

Problem reports can be sent to <pgsql-ports@postgresql.org>.
