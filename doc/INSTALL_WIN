Installing PostgreSQL on Windows NT or Windows 2000
===================================================

1.  Install the Cygwin package.

    The Cygwin package provides a UNIX-like API on top of the Win32
    API.  It is available at <http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/>.
    The 1.1.x series is recommended (1.1.4 was the latest at the time
    of this writing); using 1.0 or B20 might require extra efforts.
    For B20 you also need to download the separate crypt library at the
    same location.

2.  Install the cygipc package, available at
    <http://cygutils.netpedia.net/V1.1/cygipc/>.  Do not use versions
    prior to 1.04, they will not work.

3.  Optional:  The "Andy Piper Tools" at <http://www.xemacs.freeserve.co.uk/>
    are a collection of pre-compiled libraries and utilities that you
    might find useful -- especially on Cygwin B20.

4.  The Cygwin bin directory has to be placed in the path before the
    Windows program directories, because the sort.exe has to be taken
    from Cygwin, not Windows.

5.  Start `ipc-daemon &' (background process) from the cygipc package.
    This program needs to be running anytime you start the PostgreSQL
    server (postmaster).

6.  Proceed according to the INSTALL file.  (./configure; make; etc.)

NOTE:  By default, PostgreSQL clients like psql communicate using Unix
domain sockets, which do not work on Windows.  Start the postmaster
with -i, and when connecting to the database from a client, set the
PGHOST environment variable to `localhost' or supply the hostname on
the command line.

Problem reports can be sent to <pgsql-ports@postgresql.org>.
