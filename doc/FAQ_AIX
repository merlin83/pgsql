AIX 4.3.2 with native IBM compiler xlc 3.6.4 passes all regression tests.
Other versions of OS and compiler should also work. If you don't have 
a powerpc there might be differences in the geometry regression test.

Use the following configure flags in addition to your own
if you have readline or libz there:
--with-includes=/usr/local/include --with-libraries=/usr/local/lib

libpq++ does not work because xlC does not have the string and bool classes.
compiling the few files, that fail, with g++ does work.

Compiling PostgreSQL with gcc (2.95.2) on AIX also works.

There will probably be warnings about int8 - int64 redefines, 0.0/0.0
division and duplicate symbol warnings which you can safely ignore.
