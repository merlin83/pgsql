PostgreSQL 6.5.2 compiles and regresses ok on AIX 4.3.2 
using the IBM compiler. 
gcc has problems with shared libs that are not easily resolved.

The following regression tests fail because of different rounding
behavior or error messages: 
int2 ..  failed		-- same as int2-i386-netbsd.out
int4 ..  failed		-- same as int4-i386-netbsd.out
geometry ..  failed	-- Some Zero Values with minus sign (-0)
abstime ..  failed
tinterval ..  failed
horology ..  failed

It has the following problems:

1. AIX has int8,int16,int32,int64 in /usr/include/inttypes.h 
	--> configure fails to find snprintf support for int8 
		(because it includes stdio.h)
	I feel this is an IBM problem. I changed my /usr/include/inttypes.h
	Either do that or comment out int8-int32 in src/include/c.h.
	
2. libpq++ does not work because xlC does not have the string and bool classes.
	it does compile/work with gcc
