On AIX 4.3.2 PostgreSQL compiled with the native IBM compiler xlc
(vac.C 5.0.1) passes all regression tests.  Other versions of OS and
compiler should also work. If you don't have a powerpc or use gcc you
might see rounding differences in the geometry regression test.

Use the following configure flags in addition to your own
if you have readline or libz there:
--with-includes=/usr/local/include --with-libraries=/usr/local/lib

There will probably be warnings about 0.0/0.0 division and duplicate
symbols which you can safely ignore.

Compiling PostgreSQL with gcc (2.95.3) on AIX also works.

You need libm.a that is in the fileset bos.adt.libm.  (Try the
following command.)
$ lslpp -l bos.adt.libm

On AIX 5.3, there have been some problems getting PostgreSQL to
compile and run using GCC.

1.  You will want to use a version of GCC subsequent to 3.3.2,
    particularly if you use a prepackaged version.  We had good
    success with 4.0.1.

    Problems with earlier versions seem to have more to do with the
    way IBM packaged GCC than with actual issues with GCC, so that if
    you compile GCC yourself, you might well have success with an
    earlier version of GCC.

2.  AIX 5.3 has a problem where sockadr_storage is not defined to be
    large enough.  In version 5.3, IBM increased the size of
    sockaddr_un, the address structure for UNIX Domain Sockets, but
    did not correspondingly increase the size of sockadr_storage.

    The result of this is that attempts to use UDS with PostgreSQL
    lead to libpq overflowing the data structure.  TCP/IP connections
    work OK, but not UDS, which prevents the regression tests from
    working.

   The nonconformance may be readily demonstrated by compiling and
   running the following C program which calculates and compares the
   sizes of the various structures:

test_size.c
------------

---------- snip here - test_size.c ----------------------------
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/un.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
int main (int argc, char *argv[]) {
        struct sockaddr_storage a;
        struct sockaddr_un b;
        printf("Size of sockadr_storage: %d\n", sizeof(a));
        printf ("Size of sockaddr_un:%d\n", sizeof(b));

        if (sizeof(a) >= sizeof(b)) 
                printf ("Conformant to RFC 3493\n");
        else
                printf ("Non-conformant to RFC 3493\n");
} 
---------- snip here - test_size.c ----------------------------


The problem was reported to IBM, and is recorded as bug report
PMR29657.

An immediate resolution is to alter _SS_MAXSIZE to = 1025 in
/usr/include/sys/socket.h, which will resolve the immediate problem.

It appears that the "final" resolution will be to alter _SS_MAXSIZE to
1280, making the size nicely align with page boundaries.

IBM will be providing a fix in the next maintenance release (expected
in October 2005) with an updated socket.h.

If you upgrade to maintenance level 5300-03, that will include this
fix.  Use the command "oslevel -r" to determine what maintenance level
you are at.

Some of the AIX tools may be "a little different" from what you may be
accustomed to on other platforms.  If you are looking for a version of
ldd, useful for determining what object code depends on what
libraries, the following URLs may help you...

On AIX 5.3 ML3 (e.g. maintenance level 5300-03), there is some problem
with the handling of the pointer to memcpy.  It is speculated that
this relates to some linker bug that may have been introduced between
5300-02 and 5300-03, but we have so far been unable to track down the
cause.

At any rate, the following patch, which "unwraps" the function
reference, has been observed to allow PG 8.1 pre-releases to pass
regression tests.

The same behaviour (albeit with varying underlying functions to
"blame") has been observed when compiling with either GCC 4.0 or IBM
XLC.

The following patch works on the AIX 5.3 ML3 box here and didn't cause
any problems with postgres on the x86 desktop.  It's just a cleaner
version of what I tried earlier.
