RELIABILITY
-----------
-Overhaul mdmgr/smgr to fix double unlinking and double opens, cleanup(Erich)
-Overhaul bufmgr/lockmgr/transaction manager(Vadim)
remove -S (stable memory) option or fix memory manager
Fix CLUSTER
Fix all NULL features
	allow psql to print nulls meaningfully
Fix compile and security of Kerberos V code
Dropping a table twice causes corruption, drop/create not rollback-able
SUM aggregate on no rows or null value should return NULL, not zero
SELECT on two tables where zero or one table in WHERE and target
	clause returns no rows
fix system to use oid index using constant without cast to oid
COUNT on VIEW always returns zero (maybe because there is no oid for views?)
SELECT ... INTO TABLE ... GROUP BY ... generates unlink error
	if done three times with same INTO TABLE name (failure cleanup problem?)
CREATE VIEW requires super-user priviledge

ENHANCEMENTS
------------
Add full ANSI SQL capabilities
	add subselects, possibility using temporary SQL functions
	Implement HAVING clause
	Implement EXISTS qualifier

	add DEFAULT, RESTRAINT, and CHECK capabilities
	report "Not implemented" if valid syntax is supplied
	add OUTER joins, left and right
	make VIEWs updateable where possible
	add UNIONS, INTERSECTS, SUBTRACTS
	add temporary tables
	add assertions
	add domains
	add sql3 recursive unions
	add the concept of dataspaces

Allow compression of large fields or a compressed field type
Fix the rules system(Jan?)
	robust
	making INSTEAD rules work
	add CONSTRAINT
Full set of text operations and functions
	word searches, concat, upper/lower(), max() on text, char
Replace table-level locking with row or page-level locking(Vadim)
Large objects
	overwriting blocks has problems
	there are other problems, too.
	Fix large object mapping scheme
	not to stuff everything as files in a single directory
Better interface for adding to pg_group
Make multi-field indexes easier to create
	allow optimizer to effectively use parameters without accessing table
Add int8 type
Add MONEY/DECIMAL type with defined precision
Add table comments
Add support for tables >2G, or test current version
Incorporate the PERL PG95 interface library into source tree(Edmund)
Threaded version of the server or libpq
Allow libpq to cancel query requests
Add REGEX internationalization
Add other language types for built-in functions

	generalize the function manager switch to pass 
		function sources to interpreter engines.
	remove time-travel feature(Vadim)
	reduce system column overhead(Vadmin)
	remove pg_time table(Vadim)
	allow row re-use without vacuum, maybe?(Vadim)
	split apart row removal function from statistics function
	can't vacuum large objects
Remove restriction that ORDER BY field must be in SELECT list(?)
Allow queries about owner of datbases, tables like:
        SELECT u.usesysid FROM postgres.pg_user u;
DROP AGGREGATE should take in basetype as an arg(Darren)
Add word index for text fields, maybe with trigrams, i.e.:
    ' (cat | dog) & ! fox ' meaning text has cat or dog, but not fox
Add common-sense constant type promotions
Allow readline-type or editor command editing of multi-line SQL commands
Allow pg_dump to dump all databases at a site in one command
Allow function result to be used in GROUP BY
Populate backend status area and write program to dump status data
Add ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN feature
Remove stale files upon startup(Vivek)
Add command to show privileges
Allow INSERT INTO ... SELECT to convert column types
Add syslog functionality
Allow aggregate for All types, like count(Darren)
Improve optimizer plan choice(Darren)
Add STDDEV/VARIANCE() function for standard deviation computation/variance
Add upper/lower functions
-Add table/column/function discription table indexed by oid
-make all identifiers case-insensitive(Bruce)

PERFORMANCE
-----------
Optimizing disjunctive queries
-Add Genetic Query Optimzation for many tables (Martin)
-Fix bushy-plans (Martin)
Other optimizer bugs
Is fsync use optimized?
Multi-representational types, a la Illustra. For example, have a
       text type that is stored in-tuple when less than 8K and in large
       objects, when greater than 8K.
Use indexes in ORDER BY
Profile engine in INSERT's and other operations
Speed up hash creation by using btree's fast sort/insert routines
Cache most recent query plan(s?)
Allow compression of log and meta data
Allow LIKE/wildcard matches to use indexes if the wildcard character is not first
Add FILLFACTOR to index creation
Allow indexes to be used with OR clauses
-Add column optimization statistics to vacuum(Bruce)
-Change pg_attribute.attnvals name to attdispursion and change type float4

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
Update usermanual source
remove time-travel in documentation(Bruce)
added features used in grammer but not in docs, like :: and CAST
add DECLARE manual pages
add EXPLAIN manual page

PORTABILITY
-----------
Windows NT port
	Mariposa project at Berkeley has a person who's working on this
Win95 port, use GNU port or remove it?
Merge i386_solaris and sparc_solaris into solaris
Switch from PORTNAME to individual feature defines (use configure/autoconf?)
Change c.h "Index" and "bool" so they do not conflict with c++
