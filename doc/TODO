RELIABILITY
-----------
-Overhaul mdmgr/smgr to fix double unlinking and double opens, cleanup(Erich)
-Overhaul bufmgr/lockmgr/transaction manager(Vadim)
Fix CLUSTER
Remove EXTEND?
Fix all NULL features
	allow psql to print nulls meaningfully
Fix compile and security of Kerberos/GSSAPI code (Daniel Kalchev?)
COUNT on VIEW always returns zero (maybe because there is no oid for views?)
CREATE VIEW requires super-user priviledge
can lo_export()/lo_import() read/write anywhere, causing a security problem?
Tables that start with xinv confused to be large objects
Two and three dimmensional arrays display improperly, missing {}
Add GROUP BY and HAVING to INSERT INTO table SELECT * FROM table2
lo_unlink() crashes server
Allow variable casts with BETWEEN 'today'::asbtime AND 'today'::abstime
Prevent auto-table reference, like SELECT table.col WHERE col = 3 (?)
Remove un-needed malloc() calls and replace with palloc().
SELECT * FROM table WHERE int4_column = '1' fails
SELECT a[1] FROM test fails, it needs test.a[1]
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM TAB1, TAB2 fails
SELECT SUM(2+2) FROM table dumps core
UPDATE table SET table.value = 3 fails
UPDATE key_table SET keyval=max(reftab.NUM)+1 WHERE tblname='reftab' fails
INSERT INTO ... SELECT DISTINCT ... generates error on DISTINCT
INSERT INTO table SELECT id, count(*) FROM table2 GROUP BY id generate error

ENHANCEMENTS

	make VIEWs updateable where possible
	add UNIONS, INTERSECTS, SUBTRACTS
	add temporary tables
	add sql3 recursive unions
	add the concept of dataspaces
	allow conversion type casts on SELECT target fields
	add DECIMAL, NUMERIC, DOUBLE PRECISION, BIT, BIT VARYING
	 	NCHAR (as distinguished from ordinary varchar),
Allow compression of large fields or a compressed field type
Fix the rules system(Jan?,Soo-Ho)
	robust
	making INSTEAD rules work
	add CONSTRAINT
Full set of text operations and functions
	word searches, concat,max() on text, char
Large objects
	overwriting blocks has problems
	there are other problems, too.
	Fix large object mapping scheme
	not to stuff everything as files in a single directory
Better interface for adding to pg_group
Make MONEY/DECIMAL have a defined precision
Add support for tables >2G, or test current version
Threaded version of the server or libpq
Allow libpq to cancel query requests
Add REGEX internationalization
Add other language types for built-in functions
	expand to allow tcl, perl, java,
	generalize the function manager switch to pass 
		function sources to interpreter engines.
remove time-travel feature(Vadim)
reduce system column overhead(Vadmin)
remove pg_time table(Vadim)
allow row re-use without vacuum, maybe?(Vadim)
can't vacuum large objects
can't reduce index file size with vacuum
Remove restriction that ORDER BY field must be in SELECT list(?)
Allow queries about owner of tables, like:
        SELECT u.usesysid FROM postgres.pg_user u;
Add word index for text fields, maybe with trigrams, i.e.:
    ' (cat | dog) & ! fox ' meaning text has cat or dog, but not fox
Allow readline-type or editor command editing of multi-line SQL commands
Populate backend status area and write program to dump status data
Add ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN feature
Remove stale files upon startup(Vivek)
Add command to show privileges
Allow INSERT INTO ... SELECT to convert column types
Add syslog functionality
Add STDDEV/VARIANCE() function for standard deviation computation/variance
Add table/column/function discription table indexed by oid
add pg_type attribute to identify types that need length (bpchar, varchar)
add UNIQUE capability to non-btree indexes
make large objects have their own reltype
make number of backends a config parameter, storage/sinvaladt.h:MaxBackendId
certain indexes will not shrink, i.e. oid indexes with many inserts
make NULL's come out at the beginning or end depending on the ORDER BY direction
change the library/backend interface to use network byte order
allow unix domain sockets for local connections for performance and security
Add PAGER for psql's \dt and \d tablename

PERFORMANCE
-----------
Use indexes in ORDER BY
Allow LIKE/wildcard matches to use indexes if the wildcard character is not first
Optimizing disjunctive queries
Fix bushy-plans (Martin)
Other optimizer bugs
Is fsync use optimized?
Cache most recent query plan(s?)
Shared catalog cache, reduce lseek()'s by caching table size in shared area
Allow compression of log and meta data
Add FILLFACTOR to index creation

update pg_statistic table to remove operator column

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
Update usermanual source(many)
