1.1)	What do I need to install PostgreSQL on IRIX?

PostgreSQL 7.2 has been run on MIPS r8000, r10000(both ip25 and ip27)
and r12000(ip35) processors, running IRIX 6.5.5m, 6.5.12 and 6.5.13 with
MIPSPro compilers version 7.30, 7.3.1.2m and 7.3. 

Aside from the PostgreSQL source distribution, you will need GNU make
(SGI's make will not do), and MIPSPro full ANSI C compiler.

Until now there are problems trying to install with GNU's gcc, it is a known
gcc bug (not fixed at current date, version 3.0) using functions that return
some kind of structures. This bug affects functions like inet_ntoa,
inet_lnaof, inet_netof, inet_makeaddr and semctl.  It is supposed to be fixed
by forcing code to link those functions with libgcc, but this has not been
tested yet.


1.2)	Anything special about the build/install procedure?

In order to compile with cc you will need to:

configure with-CC=cc

Or you may edit postgres.../src/templates/irix5

including something like:

CC=cc
CFLAGS='-O2'
LDFLAGS='-O2'

It is a good place to improve performance on postgresql, because here you
may use all MIPSPro power generating specific objects, see man cc.

Other known problem is include location, it may be different from some
compiler installations to others, if you are getting something like:

cc-1020 cc: ERROR File = pqcomm.c, Line = 427
  The identifier "TCP_NODELAY" is undefined.

                if (setsockopt(port->sock, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_NODELAY,

Some versions include TCP definitions in <sys/xti.h>, so it is necessary to
add #include <sys/xti.h> in /src/backend/libpq/pqcomm.c and in
src/interfaces/libpq/fe-connect.c


1.3)	OK, it seemed to build and install, but the regression test fails.

There are several "expected failures" due to differences between your platform
and the regression test reference platform used by the PostgreSQL group.  All
of these should be compensated for by the regression test comparison
mechanism, with the possible exception of some low-order-digit differences in
the geometry tests (depending on which FPU are you using) or order differences
between zero and NULL in join tests(depending on compiler version).

Any other error is cause for suspicion.
