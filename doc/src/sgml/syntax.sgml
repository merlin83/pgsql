  <title>SQL Syntax</title>

  <abstract>
   <para>
    <acronym>SQL</acronym> manipulates sets of data. The language is
    composed of various <firstterm>key words</firstterm>. Arithmetic
    and procedural expressions are allowed. We will cover these topics
    in this chapter; subsequent chapters will include details on data
    types, functions, and operators.

   <title>Key Words</title>

   <para>
    <acronym>SQL92</acronym> defines <firstterm>key words</firstterm> 
    for the language
    which have specific meaning. Some key words are
    <firstterm>reserved</firstterm>, which indicates that they are
    restricted to appear in only certain contexts. Other key words are
    <firstterm>not restricted</firstterm>, which indicates that in certain 
    contexts they
    have a specific meaning but are not otherwise constrained.
   </para>

   <para>
    <productname>Postgres</productname> implements an extended subset of the
    <acronym>SQL92</acronym> and <acronym>SQL3</acronym> languages. Some language
    elements are not as restricted in this implementation as is
    called for in the language standards, in part due
    to the extensibility features of <productname>Postgres</productname>. 
   </para>

   <para>
    Information on <acronym>SQL92</acronym> and <acronym>SQL3</acronym> key words
    is derived from <xref linkend="DATE97" endterm="DATE97">.
   </para>

   <sect2>
    <title>Reserved Key Words</title>

    <para>
     <acronym>SQL92</acronym> and <acronym>SQL3</acronym> have 
     <firstterm>reserved key words</firstterm> which are not allowed 
     as identifiers and not allowed in any usage other than as fundamental
     tokens in <acronym>SQL</acronym> statements.
     <productname>Postgres</productname> has additional key words
     which have similar restrictions. In particular, these key words
     are not allowed as column or table names, though in some cases
     they are allowed to be column labels (i.e. in AS clauses).
    </para>

    <tip>
     <para>
      Any string can be specified as an identifier if surrounded by
      double quotes (<quote>like this!</quote>). Some care is required since
      such an identifier will be case sensitive
      and will retain embedded whitespace other special characters.
     </para>
    </tip>

    <para>
     The following are <productname>Postgres</productname>
     reserved words which are neither <acronym>SQL92</acronym>
     nor <acronym>SQL3</acronym> reserved words. These are allowed
     to be present as column labels, but not as identifiers:

     The following are <acronym>SQL92</acronym> reserved key words which

     The following are <acronym>SQL92</acronym> or <acronym>SQL3</acronym> 
     reserved key words which

     if used as type names are always translated into an alternate, native type:

    <para>
     The following are either <acronym>SQL92</acronym>
     or <acronym>SQL3</acronym> reserved key words
     which are not key words in <productname>Postgres</productname>.
     These have no proscribed usage in <productname>Postgres</productname>
     at the time of writing (v6.5) but may become reserved key words in the
     future:

     <note>
      <para>
       Some of these key words represent functions in <acronym>SQL92</acronym>.
       These functions are defined in <productname>Postgres</productname>,
       but the parser does not consider the names to be key words and they are allowed
       in other contexts.

    <title>Non-reserved Keywords</title>

    <para>
     <acronym>SQL92</acronym> and <acronym>SQL3</acronym> have 
     <firstterm>non-reserved keywords</firstterm> which have
     a proscribed meaning in the language but which are also allowed
     as identifiers.
     <productname>Postgres</productname> has additional keywords
     which allow similar unrestricted usage.
     In particular, these keywords
     are allowed as column or table names.
