 <title>Standard Modules</title>

 <para>
  This section contains information regarding the standard modules which
  can be found in the <literal>contrib</literal> directory of the
  PostgreSQL distribution. These are porting tools, analysis utilities,
  and plug-in features that are not part of the core PostgreSQL system,
  mainly because they address a limited audience or are too experimental
  to be part of the main source tree.  This does not preclude their
  usefulness.

 <para>
  Some modules supply new user-defined functions, operators, or types.  In 
  these cases, you will need to run <literal>make</literal> and <literal>make
  install</literal> in <literal>contrib/module</literal>. After you have 
  installed the files you need to register the new entities in the database 
  system by running the commands in the supplied <literal>.sql</> file.
  For example,

  <programlisting>
   $ psql -d dbname -f module.sql
  </programlisting>

  You can modify the first command in the <literal>.sql</> file to control
  the schema where the module is created.  During major upgrades, even
  though the restored database might already have the desired module
  functions, run the installation script again to add any new functions.
