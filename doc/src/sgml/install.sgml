   If you haven't gotten the <ProductName>PostgreSQL</ProductName> distribution,
   get it from <ULink url="ftp://ftp.postgresql.org">ftp.postgresql.org</ULink>,
   then unpack it:
<ProgramListing>
gunzip postgresql-7.0.tar.gz
tar -xf postgresql-7.0.tar
mv postgresql-7.0 /usr/src
</ProgramListing>

   <Title>Before you start</Title>

  <Para>
   Building <Productname>PostgreSQL</Productname> requires <acronym>GNU</acronym>
   <Application>make</Application>.  It will <Emphasis>not</Emphasis>
   work with other <Application>make</Application> programs. On GNU/Linux systems
   GNU make is the default tool, on other systems you may find that
   GNU <Application>make</Application> is installed under the name <Quote>gmake</Quote>.
   We will use that name from now on to indicate <acronym>GNU</acronym>
   <Application>make</Application>, no matter what name it has on your system.
   To test for <acronym>GNU</acronym> <Application>make</Application> enter
<programlisting>
<userinput>gmake --version</userinput>
</programlisting>
   If you need to get <acronym>GNU</acronym> <Application>make</Application>, you can
   find it at <ULink url="ftp://ftp.gnu.org">ftp://ftp.gnu.org</ULink>.
  </Para>

   <Para>
    Up to date information on supported platforms is at
    <ulink url="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/admin/ports.htm">
     http://www.postgresql.org/docs/admin/ports.htm</ulink>.
    In general, most Unix-compatible platforms with modern libraries should be able to run
    <ProductName>PostgreSQL</ProductName>. In the <filename>doc</filename> subdirectory
    of the distribution are several platform-specific FAQ and README documents you
    might wish to consult if you are having trouble.
   </para>

   <para>
    Although the minimum required memory for running <ProductName>PostgreSQL</ProductName>
    can be as little as 8MB, there are noticable speed improvements when expanding memory
    up to 96MB or beyond. The rule is you can never have too much memory.
   </para>
   <Para>
    Check that you have sufficient disk space.  You will need about
    30 Mbytes for the source tree during compilation and about 5 Mbytes for
    the installation directory. An empty database takes about 1 Mbyte, otherwise
    they take about five times the amount of space that a flat text file with the
    same data would take. If you run the regression tests you will temporarily need
    an extra 20MB.
   </Para>

   <Para>
    To check for disk space, use 
<programlisting>
df -k
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    Considering today's prices for hard disks, getting a large and fast hard disk should
    probably be in your plans before putting a database into production use.

<Title>Installation Procedure</Title>

<Procedure>
<Title><ProductName>PostgreSQL</ProductName> Installation</Title>

<Para>
For a fresh install or upgrading from previous releases of
<ProductName>PostgreSQL</ProductName>:
</Para>

<Step Performance="optional">
<Para>
Create the <ProductName>PostgreSQL</ProductName> superuser account.
This is the user the server will run as. For production use you
should create a separate, unprivileged account (<literal>postgres</literal> is
commonly used). If you do not have root access or just want to play around,
your own user account is enough.
</para>
<para>
Running <ProductName>PostgreSQL</ProductName> as <literal>root</literal>, <literal>bin</literal>,
or any other account with special access rights is a security risk;
<emphasis>don't do it</emphasis>.  The postmaster will in fact refuse
to start as root.
</para>
<Para>
You need not do the building and installation itself under this account
(although you can). You will be told when you need to login as the
database superuser.
</Para>
</Step>

<Step Performance="required">
<Para>
Configure the source code for your system.  It is this step at which
you can specify your actual installation path for the build process
and make choices about what gets installed. Change into the <filename>src</filename>
subdirectory and type:
<ProgramListing>
./configure
</ProgramListing>
followed by any options you might want to give it. For a first installation
you should be able to do fine without any.
For a complete list of options, type:
<ProgramListing>
./configure --help
</ProgramListing>
     Some of the more commonly used ones are:
<VariableList>
 <varlistentry>
  <term>--prefix=BASEDIR</term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Selects a different base directory for the installation of
    <ProductName>PostgreSQL</ProductName>. The default is <filename>/usr/local/pgsql</filename>.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>

 <varlistentry>
  <term>--enable-locale</term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    If you want to use locales.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>

 <varlistentry>
  <term>--enable-multibyte</term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Allows the use of multibyte character encodings. This is primarily for
    languages like Japanese, Korean, or Chinese.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>

 <varlistentry>
  <term>--with-perl</term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Builds the Perl interface and plperl extension language.
    Please note that the Perl interface needs to be
    installed into the usual place for Perl modules (typically under
    <filename>/usr/lib/perl</filename>), so you must have root access
    to perform the installation step.  (It is often easiest to leave out
    <option>--with-perl</option> initially, and then build and install the
    Perl interface after completing the installation of PostgreSQL
    itself.)
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>

 <varlistentry>
  <term>--with-odbc</term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Builds the ODBC driver package.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>

 <varlistentry>
  <term>--with-tcl</term>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Builds interface libraries and programs requiring
    Tcl/Tk, including libpgtcl, pgtclsh, and pgtksh.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </varlistentry>
</VariableList>

</Para>
</step>

<Step Performance="required">
<Para>
Compile the program.  Type
<ProgramListing>
gmake
</ProgramListing>
The compilation process can take anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour.
Your mileage will most certainly vary. Remember to use GNU make.
</Para>

<Para>
The last line displayed will hopefully be 
<programlisting>
All of PostgreSQL is successfully made. Ready to install.
</programlisting>
</Para>
</Step>

<Step Performance="optional">
<Para>
If you want to test the newly built server before you install it,
you can run the regression tests at this point.  The regression tests
are a test suite to verify that <ProductName>PostgreSQL</ProductName>
runs on your machine in the way the developers expected it to.
For detailed instructions see <xref linkend="regress" endterm="regress-title">.
(Be sure to use the "parallel regress test" method, since the sequential
method only works with an already-installed server.)
</Para>
</Step>

<Step Performance="required">
<Para>
If you are not upgrading an existing system then skip to 
<xref linkend="continue">.
</Para>

<Para>
You now need to back up your existing database.
To dump your fairly recent post-6.0 database installation, type
<programlisting>
pg_dumpall > db.out
</programlisting>
If you wish to preserve object id's (oids), then use the -o
option when running <application>pg_dumpall</application>.  
However, unless you have a
special reason for doing this (such as using OIDs as keys
in tables), don't do it.
</Para>

<Para>
Make sure to use the <application>pg_dumpall</application>
command from the version you are currently running.
7.0's <application>pg_dumpall</application> will not work on older databases.
However, if you are still using 6.0, do not use the
<application>pg_dumpall</application> script from 6.0 or everything will be
owned by the <ProductName>PostgreSQL</ProductName> superuser after you
reload. In that case
you should grab <application>pg_dumpall</application> from a later
6.x.x release.
If you are upgrading from a version prior to
<ProductName>Postgres95</ProductName> v1.09 then you must back up your database,
install <ProductName>Postgres95</ProductName> v1.09, restore your database,
then back it up again.
</Para>

<caution>
<Para>
     You must make sure that your database is not updated in the middle of
     your backup.  If necessary, bring down postmaster, edit the permissions
     in file <filename>/usr/local/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf</filename>
 to allow only you on, then
     bring <application>postmaster</application> back up.
</Para>
</caution>
</Step>

<Step Performance="required">
<Para>
If you are upgrading an existing system then kill the database server now. Type
<ProgramListing>
ps ax | grep postmaster
</ProgramListing>
or
<ProgramListing>
ps -e | grep postmaster
</ProgramListing>
(It depends on your system which one of these two works. No harm can be done
by typing the wrong one.)
This should list the process numbers for a number of processes, similar
to this:
<ProgramListing>
  263  ?  SW   0:00 (postmaster)
  777  p1 S    0:00 grep postmaster
</ProgramListing>
Type the following line, with <replaceable>pid</replaceable>
replaced by the process id for process <literal>postmaster</literal>
(263 in the above case). (Do not use the id for the process "grep postmaster".)
<programlisting>
kill <replaceable>pid</replaceable>
</programlisting>
</Para>

<tip>
<para>
On systems which have <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> started at boot time, there
is probably a startup file which will accomplish the same thing. For example, on a
Redhat Linux system one might find that
<programlisting>
/etc/rc.d/init.d/postgres.init stop
</programlisting>
works.
</para>
</tip>

<Para>
Also move the old directories  out of the way. Type the following:
<programlisting>
mv /usr/local/pgsql /usr/local/pgsql.old
</programlisting>
(substitute your particular paths).
</Para>

</Step>

<Step Performance="required" id="continue">
<Para>
Install the <ProductName>PostgreSQL</ProductName> executable files and
libraries.  Type
<ProgramListing>
gmake install
</ProgramListing>
</Para>
<Para>
You should do this step as the user that you want the installed executables
to be owned by.  This does not have to be the same as the database superuser;
some people prefer to have the installed files be owned by root.
</Para>
</Step>

<Step Performance="required">
<Para>
If necessary, tell your system how to find the new shared libraries.
How to do this varies between platforms. The most widely usable method
is to set the environment variable
<envar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</envar>:
<programlisting>
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</programlisting>
on sh, ksh, bash, zsh or
<programlisting>
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/pgsql/lib
</programlisting>
on csh or tcsh.
You might want to put this into a shell startup file such as
<filename>/etc/profile</filename>.
</Para>

<Para>
On some systems the following is the preferred method, but you must have root
access. Edit file <filename>/etc/ld.so.conf</filename> to add a line
<programlisting>
<FileName>/usr/local/pgsql/lib</FileName>
</programlisting>
Then run command <Command>/sbin/ldconfig</Command>.
</Para>

<Para>
If in doubt, refer to the manual pages of your system. If you later on get
a message like
<programlisting>
psql: error in loading shared libraries
libpq.so.2.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
</programlisting>
then the above was necessary.  Simply do this step then.
</Para>
</Step>

<Step Performance="required">
<Para>
Create the database installation (the working data files).
To do this you must log in to your
<ProductName>PostgreSQL</ProductName> superuser account. It will not
work as root.
<ProgramListing>
mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data
chown postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data
su - postgres
/usr/local/pgsql/initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
</ProgramListing>
</Para>
<Para>
The <option>-D</option> option specifies the location where the data will be
stored. You can use any path you want, it does not have to be under
the installation directory. Just make sure that the superuser account
can write to the directory (or create it, if it doesn't already exist)
before starting <command>initdb</command>.
(If you have already been doing the installation up to now as the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
superuser, you may have to log in as root temporarily to create the data
directory underneath a root-owned directory.)
</Para>
</Step>

<Step Performance="required">
<Para>
The previous step should have told you how to start up the database server.
Do so now.  The command should look something like
<programlisting>
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
</programlisting>
This will start the server in the foreground. To make it detach to
the background, you can use the <option>-S</option> option, but then you won't
see any log messages the server produces.  A better way to put the server
in the background is
<programlisting>
nohup /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data \
    &lt;/dev/null &gt;>server.log 2&gt;>1 &amp;

<Step Performance="optional">
<para>
If you are upgrading from an existing installation, dump your data back in:
<programlisting>
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql -d template1 -f db.out
</programlisting>
You also might want to copy over the old <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename>
file and any other files you might have had set up for authentication, such
as password files.
</Para>
</Step>
</Procedure>

<para>
This concludes the installation proper. To make your life more productive and enjoyable
you should look at the following optional steps and suggestions.
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<Para>
Life will be more convenient if you set up some environment variables. First of all
you probably want to include <filename>/usr/local/pgsql/bin</filename> (or equivalent)
into your <envar>PATH</envar>. To do this, add the following to your shell startup
file, such as <filename>~/.bash_profile</filename> (or <filename>/etc/profile</filename>,
if you want it to affect every user):
<programlisting>
PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/pgsql/bin
</programlisting>
</Para>
<Para>
Furthermore, if you set <envar>PGDATA</envar> in the environment of the PostgreSQL
superuser, you can omit the <option>-D</option> for <filename>postmaster</filename>
and <filename>initdb</filename>.
</Para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<Para>
You probably want to install the <application>man</application> and
<acronym>HTML</acronym> documentation. Type
<ProgramListing>
cd /usr/src/pgsql/postgresql-7.0/doc
gmake install
</ProgramListing>
This will install files under <filename>/usr/local/pgsql/doc</filename>
and <filename>/usr/local/pgsql/man</filename>. To enable your system
to find the <application>man</application> documentation, you need to
add a line like the following to a shell startup file:
<ProgramListing>
MANPATH=$MANPATH:/usr/local/pgsql/man
</ProgramListing>
</para>

<para>
The documentation is also available in Postscript format. If you have
a Postscript printer, or have your machine already set up to accept
Postscript files using a print filter, then to print the User's Guide
simply type
<programlisting>
cd /usr/local/pgsql/doc
gunzip -c user.ps.tz | lpr
</programlisting>
Here is how you might do it if you have Ghostscript on your system and are
writing to a laserjet printer.
<programlisting>
gunzip -c user.ps.gz | gs -sDEVICE=laserjet -r300 -q -dNOPAUSE -sOutputFile=- | lpr
</programlisting>
Printer setups can vary wildly from system to system.
If in doubt, consult your manuals or your local expert.
</para>

<para>
The Adminstrator's Guide should probably be your first reading if you
are completely new to <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>, as it contains
information about how to set up database users and authentication.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<Para>
Usually, you will want to modify your computer so that it will automatically
start the database server whenever it boots.
This is not required; the <ProductName>PostgreSQL</ProductName> server can
be run successfully from non-privileged accounts without root intervention.
</para>
<para>
Different systems have different conventions for starting up daemons at boot time,
so you are advised to familiarize yourself with them.
Most systems have a file <filename>/etc/rc.local</filename> or
<filename>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</filename> which is almost certainly no bad place
to put such a command.
Whatever you do, postmaster must be run by the <ProductName>PostgreSQL</ProductName>
superuser (<literal>postgres</literal>) <emphasis>and not by root</emphasis> or
any other user. Therefore you probably always want to form your command lines
along the lines of <literal>su -c '...' postgres</literal>.
</para>
<para>
It might be advisable to keep a log of the server output. To start the server that way
try:
<ProgramListing>
nohup su -c 'postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data > server.log 2>&1' postgres &
</ProgramListing>
</para>

<para>
Here are a few more operating system specific suggestions.

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Edit file rc.local on NetBSD or file rc2.d on SPARC Solaris
          2.5.1 to contain the following single line:
<programlisting>
su postgres -c "/usr/local/pgsql/bin/postmaster -S -D /usr/local/pgsql/data"
</programlisting>
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
In FreeBSD 2.2-RELEASE edit /usr/local/etc/rc.d/pgsql.sh to
          contain the following lines and make it chmod 755 and chown
          root:bin.

<programlisting>
#!/bin/sh
[ -x /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postmaster ] && {
    su -l pgsql -c 'exec /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postmaster
        -D/usr/local/pgsql/data
        -S -o -F > /usr/local/pgsql/errlog' &
    echo -n ' pgsql'
}
</programlisting>

          You may put the line breaks as shown above.  The shell is smart
          enough to keep parsing beyond end-of-line if there is an
          expression unfinished.  The exec saves one layer of shell under
          the postmaster process so the parent is init.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
In RedHat Linux add a file <filename>/etc/rc.d/init.d/postgres.init</filename>
which is based on the example in <filename>contrib/linux/</filename>.
Then make a softlink to this file from
 <filename>/etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S98postgres.init</filename>.
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>

</Para>

<listitem>
<Para>
Run the regression tests against the installed server (using the sequential
test method).  If you didn't run the tests before installation, you should
definitely do it now.

<Para>
To start <quote>playing around</quote>, set up the paths as explained above
and start the server. To create a database, type

to connect to that database. At the prompt you can enter SQL commands
and start experimenting.
