This document is the programmer's  manual  for  the  
<Ulink url="http://postgresql.org/"><ProductName>PostgreSQL</ProductName></Ulink>
database  management system, originally developed at the University
of California at Berkeley.

<ProductName>PostgreSQL</ProductName>  is  based  on
     <Ulink url="http://s2k-ftp.CS.Berkeley.EDU:8000/postgres/postgres.html">

The <ProductName>Postgres</ProductName> project,

<Para>
The first part of this manual 
explains  the <ProductName>Postgres</ProductName>  
approach  to  extensibility  and describe how
users can extend <ProductName>Postgres</ProductName> 
by adding user-defined types,
operators, aggregates, and both query language and programming 
language functions.
     After a discussion  of  the <ProductName>Postgres</ProductName> 
rule system, we discuss
the trigger and SPI interfaces.
     The manual concludes with a detailed description of 
the programming interfaces and
     support libraries for various languages.
