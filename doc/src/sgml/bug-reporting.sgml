 <title>Bug Reporting Guidelines</title>

 <para>
  When you encounter a bug in <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> we want to
  hear about it. Your bug reports are an important part in making
  <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> more reliable because even the utmost
  care cannot guarantee that every part of PostgreSQL will work on every
  platform under every circumstance.
 </para>

 <para>
  The following suggestions are intended to assist you in forming bug reports
  that can be handled in an effective fashion. No one is required to follow
  them but it tends to be to everyone's advantage.
 </para>

 <para>
  We cannot promise to fix every bug right away. If the bug is obvious, critical,
  or affects a lot of users, chances are good that someone will look into it. It
  could also happen that we tell you to update to a newer version to see if the
  bug happens there. Or we might decide that the bug
  cannot be fixed before some major rewrite we might be planning is done. Or
  perhaps it's simply too hard and there are more important things on the agenda.
  If you need help immediately, consider obtaining a commercial support contract.
 </para>

 <Sect2>
  <title>Identifying Bugs</title>

  <para>
   Before you ask <quote>Is this a bug?</quote>, please read and re-read the
   documentation to verify that you can really do whatever it is you are
   trying. If it is not clear from the documentation whether you can do
   something or not, please report that too, it's a bug in the documentation.
   If it turns out that the program does something different from what the
   documentation says, that's a bug. That might include, but is not limited to,
   the following circumstances:

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      A program terminates with a fatal signal or an operating system
      error message that would point to a problem in the program (for
      example not <quote>disk full</quote>).
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      A program produces the wrong output for any given input.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      A program refuses to accept valid input.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      A program accepts invalid input without a notice or error message.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> fails to compile, build, or
      install according to the instructions on supported platforms.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>

   Here <quote>program</quote> refers to any executable, not only the backend server.
  </para>

  <para>
   Being slow or resource-hogging is not necessarily a bug. Read the documentation
   or ask on one of the mailing lists for help in tuning your applications. Failing
   to comply to <acronym>SQL</acronym> is not a bug unless compliance for the
   specific feature is explicitly claimed.
  </para>

  <para>
   Before you continue, check on the TODO list and in the FAQ to see if your bug is
   already known. If you can't decode the information on the TODO list, report your
   problem. The least we can do is make the TODO list clearer.
  </para>
 </Sect2>

 <Sect2>
  <title>What to report</title>

  <para>
   The most important thing to remember about bug reporting is to state all
   the facts and only facts. Do not speculate what you think went wrong, what
   <quote>it seemed to do</quote>, or which part of the program has a fault.
   If you are not familiar with the implementation you would probably guess
   wrong and not help us a bit. And even if you are, educated explanations are
   a great supplement to but no substitute for facts. If we are going to fix
   the bug we still have to see it happen for ourselves first.
   Reporting the bare facts
   is relatively straightforward (you can probably copy and paste them from the
   screen) but all too often important details are left out because someone
   thought it doesn't matter or the report would <quote>ring a bell</quote>
   anyway.
  </para>

  <para>
   The following items should be contained in every bug report:

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The exact sequence of steps <emphasis>from program startup</emphasis>
      necessary to reproduce the problem. This should be self-contained;
      it is not enough to send in a bare select statement without the
      preceeding create table and insert statements, if the output should
      depend on the data in the tables. We do not have the time
      to decode your database schema, and if we are supposed to make up
      our own data we would probably miss the problem.
      The best format for a test case for
      query-language related problems is a file that can be run through the
      <application>psql</application> frontend
      that shows the problem. (Be sure to not have anything in your
      <filename>~/.psqlrc</filename> startup file.) You are encouraged to
      minimize the size of your example, but this is not absolutely necessary.
      If the bug is reproduceable, we'll find it either way.
     </para>
     <para>
      If your application uses some other client interface, such as PHP, then
      please try to isolate the offending queries. We probably won't set up a
      web server to reproduce your problem. In any case remember to provide
      the exact input files, do not guess that the problem happens for
      <quote>large files</quote> or <quote>mid-size databases</quote>, etc.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      The output you got. Please do not say that it <quote>didn't work</quote> or
      <quote>failed</quote>. If there is an error message,
      show it, even if you don't understand it. If the program terminates with
      an operating system error, say which. If nothing at all happens, say so.
      Even if the result of your test case is a program crash or otherwise obvious
      it might not happen on our platform. The easiest thing is to copy the output
      from the terminal, if possible.
     </para>
     <note>
      <para>
       In case of fatal errors, the error message provided by the client might
       not contain all the information available. In that case, also look at the
       output of the database server. If you do not keep your server output,
       this would be a good time to start doing so.
      </para>
     </note>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      The output you expected is very important to state. If you just write
      <quote>This command gives me that output.</quote> or <quote>This is not
      what I expected.</quote>, we might run it ourselves, scan the output, and
      think it looks okay and is exactly what we expected. We shouldn't have to
      spend the time to decode the exact semantics behind your commands.
      Especially refrain from merely saying that <quote>This is not what SQL says/Oracle
      does.</quote> Digging out the correct behavior from <acronym>SQL</acronym>
      is not a fun undertaking, nor do we all know how all the other relational
      databases out there behave. (If your problem is a program crash you can
      obviously omit this item.)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Any command line options and other startup options, including concerned
      environment variables or configuration files that you changed from the
      default. Again, be exact. If you are using a pre-packaged
      distribution that starts the database server at boot time, you should try
      to find out how that is done.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Anything you did at all differently from the installation instructions.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      The PostgreSQL version. You can run the command
      <literal>SELECT version();</literal> to
      find out. If this function does not exist, say so, then we know that
      your version is old enough. If you can't start up the server or a
      client, look into the README file in the source directory or at the
      name of your distribution file or package name. If your version is older
      than 6.5 we will almost certainly tell you to upgrade. There are tons
      of bugs in old versions, that's why we write new ones.
     </para>
     <para>
      If you run a pre-packaged version, such as RPMs, say so, including any
      subversion the package may have. If you are talking about a CVS
      snapshot, mention that, including its date and time.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Platform information. This includes the kernel name and version, C library,
      processor, memory information. In most cases it is sufficient to report
      the vendor and version, but do not assume everyone knows what exactly
      <quote>Debian</quote> contains or that everyone runs on Pentiums. If
      you have installation problems information about compilers, make, etc.
      is also necessary.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>

   Do not be afraid if your bug report becomes rather lengthy. That is a fact of life.
   It's better to report everything the first time than us having to squeeze the
   facts out of you. On the other hand, if your input files are huge, it is
   fair to ask first whether somebody is interested in looking into it.
  </para>

  <para>
   Do not spend all your time to figure out which changes in the input make
   the problem go away. This will probably not help solving it. If it turns
   out that the bug can't be fixed right away, you will still have time to
   find and share your work around. Also, once again, do not waste your time
   guessing why the bug exists. We'll find that out soon enough.
  </para>

  <para>
   When writing a bug report, please choose non-confusing terminology.
   The software package as such is called <quote>PostgreSQL</quote>,
   sometimes <quote>Postgres</quote> for short. (Sometimes
   the abbreviation <quote>Pgsql</quote> is used but don't do that.) When you
   are specifically talking about the backend server, mention that, don't
   just say <quote>Postgres crashes</quote>. The interactive frontend is called
   <quote>psql</quote> and is for all intends and purposes completely separate
   from the backend.
  </para>

  <title>Where to report bugs</title>

  <para>
   In general, send bug reports to &lt;pgsql-bugs@postgresql.org&gt;. You are
   invited to find a descriptive subject for your email message, perhaps parts
   of the error message.
  </para>

  <para> 
   Do not send bug reports to any of the user mailing lists, such as
   pgsql-sql or pgsql-general. These mailing lists are for answering
   user questions, their subscribers normally do not wish to receive
   bug reports. More importantly, they are unlikely to fix them.
  </para>

  <para>
   Also, please do <emphasis>not</emphasis> send reports to
   &lt;pgsql-hackers@postgresql.org&gt;. This list is for discussing the
   development of <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>, it would be nice
   if we could keep the bug reports separate. We might choose take up a
   discussion
   about your bug report on it, if the bug needs more review.
  </para>

  <para>
   If you have a problem with the documentation, send email to
   &lt;pgsql-docs@postgresql.org&gt;. Refer to the document, chapter, and sections.
  </para>
 
  <para>
   If your bug is a portability problem on a non-supported platform, send
   mail to &lt;pgsql-ports@postgresql.org&gt;, so we (and you) can work on
   porting <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> to your platform.
  </para>

  <note>
   <para>
    Due to the unfortunate amount of spam going around, all of the above
    email addresses are closed mailing lists. That is, you need to be
    subscribed to them in order to be allowed to post. If you simply
    want to send mail but do not want to receive list traffic, you can
    subscribe to the special pgsql-loophole <quote>list</quote>, which
    allows you to post to all <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
    mailing lists without receiving any messages. Send email to
    &lt;pgsql-loophole-request@postgresql.org&gt; to subscribe.
