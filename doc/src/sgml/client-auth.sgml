 <title>Client Authentication</title>

 <indexterm zone="client-authentication">
  <primary>client authentication</primary>
 </indexterm>

 <para>
  When a client application connects to the database server, it specifies which
  <productname>Postgres</productname> user name it wants to connect as,
  much the same way one logs into a Unix computer as a particular user.
  Within the SQL environment the active
  database user name determines access privileges to database
  objects -- see <xref linkend="user-manag"> for more information
  about that. It is therefore obviously essential to restrict which
  database user name(s) a given client can connect as.
 </para>

 <para>
  <firstterm>Authentication</firstterm> is the process by which the
  database server establishes the identity of the client, and by
  extension determines whether the client application (or the user
  who runs the client application) is permitted to connect with the
  user name that was requested.
 </para>

 <para>
  <productname>Postgres</productname> offers client authentication by
  (client) host and by database, with a number of different
  authentication methods available.
 </para>

 <para>
  <productname>Postgres</productname> database user names are logically
  separate from user names of the operating system in which the server
  runs.  If all the users of a particular server also have accounts on
  the server's machine, it makes sense to assign database user names
  that match their Unix user ids.  However, a server that accepts remote
  connections may have many users who have no local account, and in such
  cases there need be no connection between database usernames and Unix
  usernames.

  <title>The <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> file</title>

  <indexterm zone="pg-hba.conf">
   <primary>pg_hba.conf</primary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   Client authentication is controlled by the file
   <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> in the $PGDATA directory, e.g.,
   <filename>/usr/local/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf</filename>. (HBA stands
   for host-based authentication.) A default <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename>
   file is installed when the
   data area is initialized by <application>initdb</application>.
  </para>

  <para>
   The general format of the <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> file is
   of a set of records, one per line. Blank lines and lines beginning
   with a hash character (<quote>#</quote>) are ignored. A record is
   made up of a number of fields which are separated by spaces and/or
   tabs.  Records cannot be continued across lines.
  </para>

  <para>
   A record may have one of the three formats
   <synopsis>
local   <replaceable>database</replaceable> <replaceable>authentication-method</replaceable> [ <replaceable>authentication-option</replaceable> ]
host    <replaceable>database</replaceable> <replaceable>IP-address</replaceable> <replaceable>IP-mask</replaceable> <replaceable>authentication-method</replaceable> [ <replaceable>authentication-option</replaceable> ]

         <para>
          The <replaceable>authentication option</replaceable> following

   The first record that matches a connection attempt's client IP address

   authentication fails, the following records are not considered. If
   no record matches, the access will be denied.

  <para>
   The <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> file is re-read during each
   connection attempt. It is therefore trivial to modify access
   permissions while the server is running: just edit the file.

# The same, over Unix-socket connections:

# Allow any user from any host with IP address 192.168.93.x to

host         template1   192.168.93.0  255.255.255.0      ident     sameuser

# Allow a user from host 192.168.12.10 to connect to database "template1"

# In the absence of preceding "host" lines, these two lines will reject
# all connection attempts from 192.168.54.1 (since that entry will be

  <title>Authentication methods</title>

   The following describes the authentication methods in detail.

  <sect2>
   <title>Password authentication</title>

   <indexterm>
    <primary>password</primary>
   </indexterm>

   <para>
    <productname>Postgres</> database passwords are separate from any
    operating system user passwords. Ordinarily, the password for each
    database user is stored in the pg_shadow system catalog table.
    Passwords can be managed with the query language commands
    <command>CREATE USER</command> and <command>ALTER USER</command>,
    e.g., <userinput>CREATE USER foo WITH PASSWORD
    'secret';</userinput>. By default, that is, if no password has
    been set up, the stored password is <literal>NULL</literal>
    and password authentication will always fail for that user.
   </para>

   <para>
    To restrict the set of users that are allowed to connect to
    certain databases, list the set of users in a separate file (one
    user name per line) in the same directory that
    <filename>pg_hba.conf</> is in, and mention the (base) name of the
    file after the <literal>password</> or <literal>crypt</> keyword,
    respectively, in <filename>pg_hba.conf</>. If you do not use this
    feature, then any user that is known to the database system can
    connect to any database (so long as he passes password
    authentication, of course).
   </para>

   <para>
    These files can also be used to apply a different set of passwords
    to a particular database or set thereof. In that case, the files
    have a format similar to the standard Unix password file
    <filename>/etc/passwd</filename>, that is,
<synopsis>
<replaceable>username</replaceable>:<replaceable>password</replaceable>
</synopsis>
    Any extra colon separated fields following the password are
    ignored. The password is expected to be encrypted using the
    system's <function>crypt()</function> function. The utility
    program <application>pg_passwd</application> that is installed
    with <productname>Postgres</productname> can be used to manage
    these password files.
   </para>

   <para>
    Lines with and without passwords can be mixed in secondary
    password files. Lines without password indicate use of the main
    password in <literal>pg_shadow</> that is managed by
    <command>CREATE USER</> and <command>ALTER USER</>. Lines with
    passwords will cause that password to be used. A password entry of
    <quote>+</quote> also means using the pg_shadow password.
   </para>

   <para>
    Alternative passwords cannot be used when using the
    <literal>crypt</> method. The file will still be evaluated as
    usual but the password field will simply be ignored and the
    <literal>pg_shadow</> password will be used.
   </para>

   <para>
    Note that using alternative passwords like this means that one can
    no longer use <command>ALTER USER</command> to change one's
    password. It will still appear to work but the password one is
    actually changing is not the password that the system will end up
    using.

   <para>
    <productname>Kerberos</productname> is an industry-standard secure
    authentication system suitable for distributed computing over a
    public network. A description of the
    <productname>Kerberos</productname> system is far beyond the scope
    of this document; in all generality it can be quite complex (yet
    powerful). The <ulink

    build. Make sure that your server key file is readable (and
    preferably only readable) by the Postgres server account (see
    <xref linkend="postgres-user">). The location of the key file
    is specified with the <varname>krb_server_keyfile</> run time
    configuration parameter. (See also <xref linkend="runtime-config">.)
    The default is <filename>/etc/srvtab</> if you are using Kerberos 4

   <title>Ident-based authentication</title>

   <indexterm>
    <primary>ident</primary>
   </indexterm>

   <para>
    The <quote>Identification Protocol</quote> is described in
    <citetitle>RFC 1413</citetitle>. Virtually every Unix-like
    operating system ships with an ident server that listens on TCP
    port 113 by default. The basic functionality of an ident server
    is to answer questions like <quote>What user initiated the
    connection that goes out of your port <replaceable>X</replaceable>
    and connects to my port <replaceable>Y</replaceable>?</quote>.
    Since <productname>Postgres</> knows both <replaceable>X</> and
    <replaceable>Y</> when a physical connection is established, it
    can interrogate the ident server on the host of the connecting
    client and could theoretically determine the operating system user
    for any given connection this way.
   </para>

   <para>
    The drawback of this procedure is that it depends on the integrity
    of the client: if the client machine is untrusted or compromised
    an attacker could run just about any program on port 113 and
    return any user name he chooses. This authentication method is
    therefore only appropriate for closed networks where each client
    machine is under tight control and where the database and system
    administrators operate in close contact. Heed the warning:
    <blockquote>
     <attribution>RFC 1413</attribution>
     <para>
      The Identification Protocol is not intended as an authorization
      or access control protocol.
     </para>
    </blockquote>
    You must trust the machine running the ident server.
   </para>

   <para>
    When using ident-based authentication, after having determined the
    operating system user that initiated the connection,
    <productname>Postgres</productname> determines as what database
    system user he may connect. This is controlled by the ident map
    argument that follows the <literal>ident</> keyword in the
    <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> file. The simplest ident map is
    <literal>sameuser</literal>, which allows any operating system
    user to connect as the database user of the same name (if the
    latter exists). Other maps must be created manually.
   </para>

   <para>
    <indexterm><primary>pg_ident.conf</primary></indexterm>
    Ident maps are held in the file <filename>pg_ident.conf</filename>
    in the data directory, which contains lines of the general form:
<synopsis>
<replaceable>map-name</> <replaceable>ident-username</> <replaceable>database-username</>
</synopsis>
    Comments and whitespace are handled in the usual way.
    The <replaceable>map-name</> is an arbitrary name that will be
    used to refer to this mapping in <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename>.
    The other two fields specify which operating system user is
    allowed to connect as which database user. The same
    <replaceable>map-name</> can be used repeatedly to specify more
    user-mappings. There is also no restriction regarding how many
    database users a given operating system may correspond to and vice
    versa.
   </para>

   <para>
    A <filename>pg_ident.conf</filename> file that could be used in
    conjunction with the <filename>pg_hba.conf</> file in <xref

    the Unix user name bryanh, ann, or robert would not be granted access.
    Unix user robert would only be allowed access when he tries to
    connect as Postgres user <quote>bob</quote>, not as <quote>robert</quote>
    or anyone else. <quote>ann</quote> would only be allowed to connect as
    <quote>ann</>. User bryanh would be allowed to connect as either
    <quote>bryanh</> himself or as <quote>guest1</>.

   <title>Authentication problems</title>

   <para>
    Genuine authentication failures and related problems generally
    manifest themselves through error messages like the following.
   </para>

   <para>
<ProgramListing>
No pg_hba.conf entry for host 123.123.123.123, user joeblow, database testdb
</ProgramListing>
    This is what you are most likely to get if you succeed in
    contacting the server, but it doesn't want to talk to you. As the
    message suggests, the server refused the connection request
    because it found no authorizing entry in its <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename>
    configuration file.
   </para>

   <para>
<ProgramListing>
Password authentication failed for user 'joeblow'
</ProgramListing>
    Messages like this indicate that you contacted the server, and
    it's willing to talk to you, but not until you pass the
    authorization method specified in the
    <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> file. Check the password you're
    providing, or check your Kerberos or IDENT software if the
    complaint mentions one of those authentication types.
   </para>

   <para>
<ProgramListing>
FATAL 1:  user "joeblow" does not exist
</ProgramListing>
    The indicated user name was not found in pg_shadow.
   </para>

   <para>
<ProgramListing>
FATAL 1:  Database "testdb" does not exist in the system catalog.
</ProgramListing>
    The database you're trying to connect to doesn't exist. Note that
    if you don't specify a database name, it defaults to the database
    user name, which may or may not be the right thing.
