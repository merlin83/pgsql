  <para>
   <application>ipcclean</application>
   cleans up shared memory and semaphore space from aborted backends by
   deleting all instances owned by user <literal>postgres</literal>.
   Only the DBA
   should execute this program as it can cause bizarre behavior (i.e.,
   crashes) if run during multi-user execution.  This program should be
   executed if messages such as

   <computeroutput>
semget: No space left on device
   </computeroutput>

   are encountered when starting up the 
   <application>postmaster</application> or the backend server.
  </para>

  <para>
   If this command is executed while <application>postmaster</application>
   is running, the shared memory and semaphores allocated by the
   <application>postmaster</application>
   will be deleted.  This will result in a general failure of the
   backend servers started by that
   <application>postmaster</application>.
  </para>

  <para>
   This script is a hack, but in the many years since it was written, no
   one has come up with an equally effective and portable solution.
   Suggestions are welcome.
  </para>

  <para>
   The script makes assumption about the format of output of the
   <application>ipcs</application>
   utility which may not be true across different operating systems.
   Therefore, it may not work on your particular OS.
