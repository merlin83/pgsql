   <para>
    <application>postmaster</application> accepts the following command line arguments:
    
    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>-B <replaceable class="parameter">nBuffers</replaceable></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	Sets the number of shared-memory disk buffers for the 
	<application>postmaster</application>
	to allocate for use by the backend server processes that it
	starts.  This value defaults to 64 buffers, where each buffer is 8k bytes
	(or whatever BLCKSZ is set to in src/include/config.h).
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>-D <replaceable class="parameter">DataDir</replaceable></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	Specifies the directory to use as the root of the tree of database
	directories.  If -D is not given, the default data directory name is
	the value of the environment variable 
	<envar>PGDATA</envar>.
	If <envar>PGDATA</envar> is not set, then the directory used is
	<filename>$POSTGRESHOME/data</filename>.
	If neither environment variable is set and this command-line
	option is not specified, the default directory that was
	set at compile-time is used.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>-N <replaceable class="parameter">maxBackends</replaceable></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	Sets the maximum number of backend server processes that this postmaster
	is allowed to start.  By default, this value is 32, but it can be set
	as high as 1024 if your system will support that many processes.
	(Note that -B is required to be at least twice -N, so you'll need to
	increase -B if you increase -N.)
	Both the default and upper limit values for -N can be altered
	when building <productname>Postgres</productname>
	(see src/include/config.h).
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>-S</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	Specifies that the <application>postmaster</application>
	process should start up in silent mode.  That is, it will disassociate
	from the user's (controlling) tty, start its own process group, and
	redirect its standard output and standard error to
	<filename>/dev/null</filename>.
       </para>
       <para>
	<emphasis>Note</emphasis> that using this switch makes it very
	difficult to troubleshoot problems, since all tracing and logging
	output that would normally be generated by this postmaster and its
	child backends will be discarded.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>-d <replaceable class="parameter">DebugLevel</replaceable></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	Determines the amount of debugging output the backend servers will
	produce.
	If <replaceable class="parameter">DebugLevel</replaceable>
	is one, the postmaster will trace all connection traffic.
	Levels two and higher turn on increasing amounts of debug output
	from the backend processes, and the postmaster
	displays more information
	including the backend environment and process traffic.
	Note that unless the postmaster's standard output and standard error
	are redirected into a log file, all this output will appear on the
	controlling tty of the <application>postmaster</application>.
       </para>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>-h <replaceable class="parameter">hostName</replaceable></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	Specifies the TCP/IP hostname or address
	on which the <application>postmaster</application>
	is to listen for connections from frontend applications.  Defaults to
	the value of the <envar>PGHOST</envar> 
	environment variable, or if <envar>PGHOST</envar>
	is not set, it defaults to listening on all configured addresses
	(including localhost).
       </para>
       <para>
	If you use a hostname do not try to run
	multiple instances of <application>postmaster</application> on the
	same IP address but different ports.  Doing so will result in them
	attempting (incorrectly) to use the same shared memory segments.
	Also, if you use a hostname, all of the host's IP addresses
	on which <application>postmaster</application> instances are
	listening must be distinct in the two last octets.
       </para>
       <para>
	If you don't use this option, each instance must listen on a
	different port (via -p or <envar>PGPORT</envar>).  And, of course, do
	not try to use both approaches on one host.
       </para>

      <term>-i</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        Allows clients to connect via TCP/IP (Internet domain) connections.
	Without this option, only local Unix domain socket connections are
	accepted.

     <varlistentry>
      <term>-k <replaceable class="parameter">path</replaceable></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	Specifies the local Unix domain socket path name
	on which the <application>postmaster</application>
	is to listen for connections from frontend applications.  Defaults to
	the value of the 
	<envar>PGUNIXSOCKET</envar> 
	environment variable, or if <envar>PGUNIXSOCKET</envar>
	is not set, then defaults to a file in <filename>/tmp</filename>
	constructed from the port number.
       </para>
       <para>
        You can use this option to put the Unix-domain socket in a
        directory that is private to one or more users using Unix
	directory permissions.  This is necessary for securely
	creating databases automatically on shared machines.
        In that situation, also disallow all TCP/IP connections
	initially in <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename>.
	If you specify a socket path other than the
	default then all frontend applications (including
	<application>psql</application>) must specify the same
	socket path using either command-line options or
	<envar>PGUNIXSOCKET</envar>.
       </para>

	is also required.
	You must have compiled with SSL enabled to use this option.

       <para>
	The 
	<literal>postgres</literal>
	option(s) specified in
	<replaceable class="parameter">BackendOptions</replaceable>
	are passed to all backend server processes started by this
	<application>postmaster</application>.
	If the option string contains any spaces, the entire string must be
	quoted.
       </para>
      </listitem>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>-p <replaceable class="parameter">port</replaceable></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	Specifies the TCP/IP port or local Unix domain socket file extension
	on which the <application>postmaster</application>
	is to listen for connections from frontend applications.  Defaults to
	the value of the 
	<envar>PGPORT</envar> 
	environment variable, or if <envar>PGPORT</envar>
	is not set, then defaults to the value established when Postgres was
	compiled (normally 5432).  If you specify a port other than the
	default port, then all frontend applications (including
	<application>psql</application>) must specify the same
	port using either command-line options or
	<envar>PGPORT</envar>.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
   </para>

   <para>
    Two additional command line options are available for debugging problems
    that cause a backend to die abnormally.
    These options control the behavior of the
    <application>postmaster</application> in this situation, and
    <emphasis>neither option is intended for use in
     ordinary operation</emphasis>.
   </para>

   <para>
    The ordinary strategy for this situation is to notify all other
    backends that they must terminate and then reinitialize the shared
    memory and semaphores.  This is because an errant backend could have
    corrupted some shared state before terminating.
   </para>

   <para>
    These special-case options are:

    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>-n</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	<application>postmaster</application>
	will not reinitialize shared data structures.  A knowledgeable system
	programmer can then use a debugger
	to examine shared memory and semaphore state.
       </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>-s</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	<application>postmaster</application>
	will stop all other backend processes by sending the signal
	<literal>SIGSTOP</literal>,
	but will not cause them to terminate.  This permits system programmers
	to collect core dumps from all backend processes by hand.

on BSD-based systems, or
	<programlisting>
$ ps -e | grep postmast

       <para>
	If you

	different port using the
	<literal>-p</literal>
	option.  You may also get this error if you terminate the
	<application>postmaster</application>
	and immediately restart it using the same port; in this case, you must
	simply wait a few seconds until the operating system closes the port
	before trying again.  Finally, you may get this error if you specify
	a port number that your operating system considers to be reserved.
	For example, many versions of Unix consider port numbers under 1024 to
	be <firstterm>trusted</firstterm>
	and only permit the Unix superuser to access them.

	A likely explanation is that another user attempted to start a
	<application>postmaster</application>
	process on the same port which acquired shared resources and then 
	died.  Since Postgres shared memory keys are based on the port number 
	assigned to the
	<application>postmaster</application>,
	such conflicts are likely if there is more than one installation on 
	a single host.  If there are no other
	<application>postmaster</application>
	processes currently running (see above), run
	<application>ipcclean</application>
	and try again.  If other <application>postmaster</application>
	images
	are running, you will have to find the owners of those processes to
	coordinate the assignment of port numbers and/or removal of unused
	shared memory segments.

  <para>
   <application>postmaster</application>
   manages the communication between frontend and backend processes, as
   well as allocating the shared buffer pool and SysV semaphores
   (on machines without a test-and-set instruction).
   <application>postmaster</application>
   does not itself interact with the user and should be started as a
   background process.
  </para>

  <para>
   <emphasis>Only one postmaster should be running at a time in a given
    <productname>Postgres</productname> installation.</emphasis>
   Here, an installation means a database directory and
   <application>postmaster</application> port number.
   You can run more than one postmaster on a machine only if each one has a
   separate directory and port number.

  <para>
   If at all possible,
   <emphasis>do not</emphasis>
   use <literal>SIGKILL</literal>
   when killing the <application>postmaster</application>.
   <literal>SIGHUP</literal>,
   <literal>SIGINT</literal>,
   or
   <literal>SIGTERM</literal>
   (the default signal for 
   <application>kill</application>(1))"
   should be used instead. Using

   <programlisting>
$ kill -KILL
   </programlisting>

or its alternative form

   <programlisting>
$ kill -9
   </programlisting>

   will prevent <application>postmaster</application>
   from freeing the system resources (e.g., shared memory and semaphores)
   that it holds before dying.  Use <literal>SIGTERM</literal> instead
   to avoid having to clean up manually (as described earlier).

  <para>
   To start <application>postmaster</application> using default
   values, type:

   <programlisting>
$ nohup postmaster >logfile 2>&1 &
   </programlisting>

   This command will start up <application>postmaster</application>

  <para>
   To start <application>postmaster</application> with a specific port:

   <programlisting>
$ nohup postmaster -p 1234 &
   </programlisting>

   This command will start up <application>postmaster</application>
   communicating through the port 1234. In order to
   connect to this <application>postmaster</application>
   using psql, you would need to run it as

   <programlisting>
$ psql -p 1234
   </programlisting>

   or set the environment variable <envar>PGPORT</envar>:

   <programlisting>
$ export PGPORT 1234
