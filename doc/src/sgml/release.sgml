<Para>
  The regression tests have been adapted and extensively modified for the
  v6.1 release of PostgreSQL.
</Para>

<Para>
  Three new data types (datetime, timespan, and circle) have been added to
  the native set of PostgreSQL types. Points, boxes, paths, and polygons
  have had their output formats made consistant across the data types.
  The polygon output in misc.out has only been spot-checked for correctness
  relative to the original regression output.
</Para>

<Para>
  PostgreSQL v6.1 introduces a new, alternate optimizer which uses <FirstTerm>genetic</FirstTerm>
  algorithms. These algorithms introduce a random behavior in the ordering
  of query results when the query contains multiple qualifiers or multiple
  tables (giving the optimizer a choice on order of evaluation). Several
  regression tests have been modified to explicitly order the results, and
  hence are insensitive to optimizer choices. A few regression tests are
  for data types which are inherently unordered (e.g. points and time
  intervals) and tests involving those types are explicitly bracketed with
  <Command>set geqo to 'off'</Command> and <Command>reset geqo</Command>.
</Para>

<Para>
  The interpretation of array specifiers (the curly braces around atomic
  values) appears to have changed sometime after the original regression
  tests were generated. The current <FileName>./expected/*.out</FileName> files reflect this
  new interpretation, which may not be correct!
</Para>

<Para>
  The float8 regression test fails on at least some platforms. This is due
  to differences in implementations of pow() and exp() and the signaling
  mechanisms used for overflow and underflow conditions.
</Para>

<Para>
  The "random" results in the random test should cause the "random" test
  to be "failed", since the regression tests are evaluated using a simple
  diff. However, "random" does not seem to produce random results on my 
  test machine (Linux/gcc/i686).
</Para>

<Sect1>
<Title>Timing Results</Title>

<Para>
These timing results are from running the regression test with the command

<ProgramListing>
% time make runtest
</ProgramListing>

<Para>
  Timing under Linux 2.0.27 seems to have a roughly 5% variation from run
  to run, presumably due to the timing vagaries of multitasking systems.
