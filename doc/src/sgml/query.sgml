  <title>The Query Language</title>

  <para>
   The  <productname>Postgres</productname>  query language is a variant of
   the <acronym>SQL</acronym> standard. It
   has many extensions to <acronym>SQL</acronym> such as an
   extensible type  system,
   inheritance,  functions and production rules. These are
   features carried over from the original
   <productname>Postgres</productname>  query
   language,  <productname>PostQuel</productname>.
   This section provides an overview
   of how to use <productname>Postgres</productname>
   <acronym>SQL</acronym>  to  perform  simple  operations.
   This manual is only intended to give you an idea of our
   flavor of <acronym>SQL</acronym> and is in no way a complete  tutorial  on
   <acronym>SQL</acronym>.  Numerous  books  have  been  written  on
   <acronym>SQL92</acronym>, including
   <xref linkend="MELT93" endterm="MELT93"> and
   <xref linkend="DATE97" endterm="DATE97">.
   You should be  aware  that  some language features 
   are extensions to the standard.

  <sect1 id="query-concepts">
   <title>Concepts</title>

   <para>
    The fundamental notion in <productname>Postgres</productname> is
    that of a <firstterm>table</firstterm>, which is a named
    collection of <firstterm>rows</firstterm>.  Each row has the same
    set of named <firstterm>columns</firstterm>, and each column is of
    a specific type.  Furthermore, each row has a permanent
    <firstterm>object identifier</firstterm> (<acronym>OID</acronym>)
    that is unique throughout the database cluster.  Historially,
    tables have been called classes in
    <productname>Postgres</productname>, rows are object instances,
    and columns are attributes.  This makes sense if you consider the
    object-relational aspects of the database system, but in this
    manual we will use the customary <acronym>SQL</acronym>
    terminology.  As previously discussed,
    tables are grouped into databases, and a collection of databases
    managed by a single <application>postmaster</application> process
    constitutes a database cluster.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="query-table">
   <title>Creating a New Table</title>

   <para>
    You  can  create  a  new  table by specifying the table
    name, along with all column names and their types:

<programlisting>
CREATE TABLE weather (
    city            varchar(80),
    temp_lo         int,           -- low temperature
    temp_hi         int,           -- high temperature
    prcp            real,          -- precipitation
    date            date
);
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    Note that both keywords and identifiers are case-insensitive;
    identifiers can preserve case by surrounding them with
    double-quotes as allowed
    by <acronym>SQL92</acronym>.
    <productname>Postgres</productname>  <acronym>SQL</acronym>
    supports the usual
    <acronym>SQL</acronym> types <type>int</type>,
    <type>float</type>,  <type>real</type>,  <type>smallint</type>,
<type>char(N)</type>,  
    <type>varchar(N)</type>,  <type>date</type>, <type>time</type>,
    and <type>timestamp</type>, as well as other types of general utility and
    a rich set of geometric types.  As we will 
    see later, <productname>Postgres</productname> can be customized
    with an  
    arbitrary  number  of
    user-defined  data types.  Consequently, type names are
    not syntactical keywords, except where required to support special
    cases in the <acronym>SQL92</acronym> standard.
    So far, the <productname>Postgres</productname>
    <command>CREATE</command> command
    looks exactly  like
    the  command  used  to  create a table in a traditional
    relational system.  However, we will presently see that
    tables  have  properties  that  are  extensions of the
    relational model.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="query-populate">
   <title>Populating a Table with Rows</title>

   <para>
    The <command>INSERT</command> statement is used to populate a table  with
    rows:

<programlisting>
INSERT INTO weather VALUES ('San Francisco', 46, 50, 0.25, '1994-11-27');
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    You can also use <command>COPY</command> to load large
    amounts of data from flat (<acronym>ASCII</acronym>) files.
    This is usually faster because the data is read (or written) as a
    single atomic
    transaction directly to or from the target table. An example would be:

<programlisting>
COPY weather FROM '/home/user/weather.txt' USING DELIMITERS '|';
</programlisting>

    where the path name for the source file must be available to the
    backend server
    machine, not the client, since the backend server reads the file directly.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="query-query">
   <title>Querying a Table</title>

   <para>
    The <classname>weather</classname> table can be queried with normal relational
    selection  and projection queries.  A <acronym>SQL</acronym>
    <command>SELECT</command> 
    statement is used to do this.  The statement is divided into
    a target list (the part that lists the columns to be
    returned) and a qualification (the part that  specifies
    any  restrictions).   For  example, to retrieve all the
    rows of weather, type:
<programlisting>
SELECT * FROM weather;
</programlisting>

    and the output should be:
<programlisting>
+--------------+---------+---------+------+------------+
|city          | temp_lo | temp_hi | prcp | date       |
+--------------+---------+---------+------+------------+
|San Francisco | 46      | 50      | 0.25 | 1994-11-27 |
+--------------+---------+---------+------+------------+
|San Francisco | 43      | 57      | 0    | 1994-11-29 |
+--------------+---------+---------+------+------------+
|Hayward       | 37      | 54      |      | 1994-11-29 |
+--------------+---------+---------+------+------------+
</programlisting>
    You may specify any arbitrary expressions in the  target list. For 
    example, you can do:
<programlisting>
SELECT city, (temp_hi+temp_lo)/2 AS temp_avg, date FROM weather;
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    Arbitrary  Boolean  operators
    (<command>AND</command>,  <command>OR</command> and 
    <command>NOT</command>) are
    allowed in the qualification of any query.   For  example,

<programlisting>
SELECT * FROM weather
    WHERE city = 'San Francisco'
    AND prcp > 0.0;
</programlisting>
results in:
<programlisting>
+--------------+---------+---------+------+------------+
|city          | temp_lo | temp_hi | prcp | date       |
+--------------+---------+---------+------+------------+
|San Francisco | 46      | 50      | 0.25 | 1994-11-27 |
+--------------+---------+---------+------+------------+
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    As  a final note, you can specify that the results of a
    select can be returned in a <firstterm>sorted order</firstterm>
    or with duplicate rows removed.

<programlisting>
SELECT DISTINCT city
    FROM weather
    ORDER BY city;
</programlisting>
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="query-selectinto">
   <title>Redirecting SELECT Queries</title>

   <para>
    Any <command>SELECT</command> query can be redirected to a new table
<programlisting>
SELECT * INTO TABLE temp FROM weather;
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    This forms an implicit <command>CREATE</command> command, creating a new
    table temp with the column names and types specified
    in  the target list of the <command>SELECT INTO</command> command.  We can
    then, of course, perform any operations on the  resulting 
    table that we can perform on other tables.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="query-join">
   <title>Joins Between Tables</title>

   <para>
    Thus far, our queries have only accessed one table at a
    time.  Queries can access multiple tables at once,  or
    access  the  same  table  in  such  a way that multiple
    rows of the table are being processed at the  same
    time.   A query that accesses multiple rows of the
    same or different tables at one time is called a  join
    query.
    As an example, say we wish to find all the records that
    are in the  temperature  range  of  other  records.  In
    effect,  we  need  to  compare  the temp_lo and temp_hi
    columns of each WEATHER  row  to  the  temp_lo  and
    temp_hi  columns of all other WEATHER columns.
    <note>
     <para>
      This  is only a conceptual model.  The actual join may
      be performed in a more efficient manner, but this is invisible
      to the user.
     </para>
    </note>

    We can do this with the following query:

<programlisting>
SELECT W1.city, W1.temp_lo AS low, W1.temp_hi AS high,
    W2.city, W2.temp_lo AS low, W2.temp_hi AS high
    FROM weather W1, weather W2
    WHERE W1.temp_lo < W2.temp_lo
    AND W1.temp_hi > W2.temp_hi;

+--------------+-----+------+---------------+-----+------+
|city          | low | high | city          | low | high |
+--------------+-----+------+---------------+-----+------+
|San Francisco | 43  | 57   | San Francisco | 46  | 50   |
+--------------+-----+------+---------------+-----+------+
|San Francisco | 37  | 54   | San Francisco | 46  | 50   |
+--------------+-----+------+---------------+-----+------+
</programlisting>     

    <note>
     <para>
      The semantics of such a join are 
      that the qualification
      is a truth expression defined for the Cartesian  product  of
      the tables indicated in the query.  For those rows in
      the Cartesian product for which the qualification  is  true,
      <productname>Postgres</productname>  computes  and  returns the
      values specified in the target list.  
      <productname>Postgres</productname> <acronym>SQL</acronym>
      does not assign  any  meaning  to
      duplicate values in such expressions. 
      This means that <productname>Postgres</productname> 
      sometimes recomputes the same target list several times;
      this frequently happens when Boolean expressions are connected 
      with an "or".  To remove such duplicates, you must  use
      the <command>SELECT DISTINCT</command> statement.
     </para>
    </note>
   </para>

   <para>
    In this case, both <literal>W1</literal> and
    <literal>W2</literal>  are  surrogates for  a
    row of the table weather, and both range over all
    rows of the table.  (In the  terminology  of  most
    database  systems, <literal>W1</literal> and <literal>W2</literal> 
    are known as <firstterm>range variables</firstterm>.)  
    A query can contain an  arbitrary  number  of
    table names and surrogates.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="query-update">
   <title>Updates</title>

   <para>
    You can update existing rows using the
    <command>UPDATE</command> command. 
    Suppose you discover the temperature readings are
    all  off  by 2 degrees as of Nov 28, you may update the
    data as follow:

<programlisting>
UPDATE weather
    SET temp_hi = temp_hi - 2,  temp_lo = temp_lo - 2
    WHERE date > '1994-11-28';
</programlisting>
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="query-delete">
   <title>Deletions</title>

   <para>
    Deletions are performed using the <command>DELETE</command> command:
<programlisting>
DELETE FROM weather WHERE city = 'Hayward';
</programlisting>

    All weather recording belonging to Hayward are removed.
    One should be wary of queries of the form
<programlisting>
DELETE FROM <replaceable>tablename</replaceable>;
</programlisting>

    Without a qualification, <command>DELETE</command> will simply
    remove  all  rows from the given table, leaving it
    empty.  The system will not request confirmation before
    doing this.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="query-agg">
   <title>Using Aggregate Functions</title>

   <para>
    Like  most  other relational database products, 
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> supports
    aggregate functions.
    An aggregate function computes a single result from multiple input rows.
    For example, there are aggregates to compute the
    <function>count</function>, <function>sum</function>,
    <function>avg</function> (average), <function>max</function> (maximum) and
    <function>min</function> (minimum) over a set of rows.
   </para>

   <para>
    It is important to understand the interaction between aggregates and
    SQL's <command>WHERE</command> and <command>HAVING</command> clauses.
    The fundamental difference between <command>WHERE</command> and
    <command>HAVING</command> is this: <command>WHERE</command> selects
    input rows before groups and aggregates are computed (thus, it controls
    which rows go into the aggregate computation), whereas
    <command>HAVING</command> selects group rows after groups and
    aggregates are computed.  Thus, the
    <command>WHERE</command> clause may not contain aggregate functions;
    it makes no sense to try to use an aggregate to determine which rows
    will be inputs to the aggregates.  On the other hand,
    <command>HAVING</command> clauses always contain aggregate functions.
    (Strictly speaking, you are allowed to write a <command>HAVING</command>
    clause that doesn't use aggregates, but it's wasteful; the same condition
    could be used more efficiently at the <command>WHERE</command> stage.)
   </para>

   <para>
    As an example, we can find the highest low-temperature reading anywhere
    with

    <programlisting>
SELECT max(temp_lo) FROM weather;
    </programlisting>

    If we want to know what city (or cities) that reading occurred in,
    we might try

    <programlisting>
SELECT city FROM weather WHERE temp_lo = max(temp_lo);
    </programlisting>

    but this will not work since the aggregate
    <function>max</function> can't be used in
    <command>WHERE</command>. However, as is often the case the query can be
    restated to accomplish the intended result; here by using a
    <firstterm>subselect</firstterm>:

    <programlisting>
SELECT city FROM weather
    WHERE temp_lo = (SELECT max(temp_lo) FROM weather);
    </programlisting>

    This is OK because the sub-select is an independent computation that
    computes its own aggregate separately from what's happening in the outer
    select.
   </para>

   <para>
    Aggregates are also very useful in combination with
    <command>GROUP BY</command> clauses.  For example, we can get the
    maximum low temperature observed in each city with

    <programlisting>
SELECT city, max(temp_lo)
    FROM weather
    GROUP BY city;
    </programlisting>

    which gives us one output row per city.  We can filter these grouped
    rows using <command>HAVING</command>:

    <programlisting>
SELECT city, max(temp_lo)
    FROM weather
    GROUP BY city
    HAVING min(temp_lo) < 0;
    </programlisting>

    which gives us the same results for only the cities that have some
    below-zero readings.  Finally, if we only care about cities whose
    names begin with "<literal>P</literal>", we might do

    <programlisting>
SELECT city, max(temp_lo)
    FROM weather
    WHERE city like 'P%'
    GROUP BY city
    HAVING min(temp_lo) < 0;
    </programlisting>

    Note that we can apply the city-name restriction in
    <command>WHERE</command>, since it needs no aggregate.  This is
    more efficient than adding the restriction to <command>HAVING</command>,
    because we avoid doing the grouping and aggregate calculations
    for all rows that fail the <command>WHERE</command> check.
