   <title>What's In This Book</title>

   <para>
    This book describes the use of the <acronym>SQL</acronym> language
    in <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.  We start with
    describing the general syntax of <acronym>SQL</acronym>, then
    explain how to create the structures to hold data, how to populate
    the database, and how to query it.  The middle part lists the
    available data types and functions for use in
    <acronym>SQL</acronym> data commands.  The rest of the book treats
    several aspects that are important for tuning a database for
    optimal performance.
