   <title>What's In This Book</title>

   <para>
    This book covers topics that are of interest to a PostgreSQL
    database administrator.  This includes installation of the
    software, set up and configuration of the server, management of
    users and databases, and maintenance tasks.  Anyone who runs a
    PostgreSQL server, either for personal use, but especially in
    production, should be familiar with the topics covered in this
    book.
   </para>

   <para>
    The information in this book is arranged approximately in the
    order in which a new user should read it.  But the chapters are
    self-contained and can be read individually as desired.  The
    information in this book is presented in a narrative fashion in
    topical units.  Readers looking for a complete description of a
    particular command should look into the &cite-reference;.
   </para>

   <para>
    The first few chapters are written so that they can be understood
    without prerequisite knowledge, so that new users who need to set
    up their own server can begin their exploration with this book.
    The rest of this book which is about tuning and management
    presupposes that the reader is familiar with the general use of
    the PostgreSQL database system.  Readers are encouraged to look at
    the &cite-tutorial; and the &cite-user; for additional
    information.
