Section 1:      Compiling Postgres95
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1)    What changes do I need to make to src/Makefile.global

        You *must* set the following variables:
                PORTNAME=       linux

        You will also need to change the following to match your own
        installation:
                SRCDIR
                POSTGRESDIR

        If you switch on the USE_TCL option, you will need to set these:
                TCL_INCDIR=
                TCL_LIBDIR=
                TCL_LIB=
                TK_INCDIR=
                TK_LIBDIR=
                TK_LIB=
                X11_INCDIR=
                X11_LIBDIR=
                X11_LIB=

        On my Slackware3.0 system, these are:
                TCL_INCDIR=     /usr/include/tcl
                TCL_LIBDIR=     /usr/lib
                TCL_LIB=        -ltcl
                TK_INCDIR=      /usr/include/tcl
                TK_LIBDIR=      /usr/lib
                TK_LIB=         -ltk
                X11_INCDIR=     /usr/include/X11
                X11_LIBDIR=     /usr/X386/lib
                X11_LIB=        -lX11
 
        You may also make any other changes you need as documented in
        the INSTALL file and in Makefile.global


1.2)    Why do I get problems with missing libreadline?

        Linux systems generally don't come with the GNU readline library
        installed. Either comment out the USE_READLINE variable in   
        src/Makefile.global or install the GNU readline library.

        Note that Debian Linux (like FreeBSD) does come with readline
        installed.

1.3)    [REDHAT] Why do I get problems with missing libdl and dlfcn.h?

        The libdl library is used for dynamic linking of user-supplied
        functions at run-time. For some reason this library was missed out
        from the Redhat distribution. It seems that the latest Redhat 4.0
        (Colgate) fixes this.

        RedHat now have a new ld.so RPM package on their FTP site.
        Simply grab:

                ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/devel/i386/RedHat/RPMS/ld.so-1.7.14-4.i386.rpm

        Install the RPM file in the usual way and off you go!

        There has been one report of a corrupted system resulting from
        programs accessing these libraries while updating them (not
        altogether surprising). Consequently it is a good idea to reboot 
        the system before installing the new libraries and to
        have as little running as possible during this upgrade. Going
        into single-user mode is probably a good idea!

        If you want to do it the hard way, you can obtain the library and the 
        header file from:
        
                ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages/GCC/ld.so-1.7.14.tar.gz

        Alternatively, you may find precompiled binaries in 
        distributions/debian/buzz/binary-i386/base/ld.so-1.7.14-4.deb
        on the same site, or follow the instructions given for question 1.2 for
        correcting the same error with early releases of Slackware 3.1.
        Don't use this method unless you know what you are doing!



1.4)    [SLACKWARE 3.1] Why do I get problems with missing libdl and dlfcn.h?

        See the answer to question 1.3. Slackware up to version 3.0 was 
        supplied with this library and include file and they seem to be
        back in again in the latest versions of 3.1, but the early 3.1
        releases (before 9th September 1996) had them missing and many 
        CD-ROM versions will have been pressed from the first 3.1 releases.

        There has been one report of a corrupted system resulting from
        programs accessing these libraries while updating them (not
        altogether surprising). Consequently it is a good idea to reboot 
        the system before installing the new libraries and to
        have as little running as possible during this upgrade. Going
        into single-user mode is probably a good idea!

        The easiest fix is to obtain the file ldso.tgz from the a4 disk of
        a more recent Slackware 3.1 distribution and unpack this file
        from the root (/) directory, then do

                sh install/doinst.sh

        to complete the installation. Follow this with

                ldconfig

        If you want to install manually, you must first install the file
        dlfcn.h in /usr/include.

        Second, install the file libdl.so.1.7.14 (or whatever the latest
        release is) in /lib, then do:

                cd /lib
                ln -sf libdl.so.1.7.14 libdl.so.1
                ln -sf libdl.so.1 libdl.so

        On some systems (depending on your GCC configuration) it may be
        necessary to do:

                cd /usr/lib
                ln -sf /lib/libdl.so .

        Finally

                ldconfig


1.5)    My compile of the backend dies complaining about the include file 
        dlfcn.h missing

        See the answer to question 1.3/1.4. Don't forget that if you are using
        an a.out system you must first have installed the dld package
        (which is not supplied with most a.out systems) to have dlfcn.h
        at all. See Question 1.11.


1.6)    GCC complains about an ignored option -fpic

        Earlier versions of GCC accepted either -fpic or -fPIC.
        It appears that more recent versions (V2.7.2?) require -fPIC. 
        If you are using an ELF version of Linux, this can safely be 
        ignored as -fPIC is the default.

        You can correct this by editing
        src/mk/port/postgres.mk.linux


1.7)    I get warnings of the form 
        warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size

        These can safely be ignored

1.8)    [SuSE-Linux 4.2] Where is curses and termcap?

        SuSE-Linux has ncurses but not curses. Edit src/bin/psql/Makefile and 
        Change
                LIBCURSES=   -lcurses
        to
                LIBCURSES=   -lncurses

        SuSE-Linux has the termcap library is in /usr/lib/termcap instead of 
        in /usr/lib
        Edit src/bin/psql/Makefile and
        Change
                ifeq ($(PORTNAME), linux)
                LD_ADD += -ltermcap
                else
        to
                ifeq ($(PORTNAME), linux)
                LD_ADD += -L/usr/lib/termcap -ltermcap
                else

        In fact, since ncurses uses terminfo rather than termcap, it should
        be possible to change this line to
                LD_ADD += 
        since you shouldn't need the termcap library.

1.9)    Why do I get problems with ld.so?

        If you get problems with ld.so, another library required under
        ELF for dynamic loading, then you have messed up your installation
        or (more likely) upgrade of Linux.

        See the answers to Question 1.3/1.4. You may need to install
        ld.so.x.y.z in /lib and run ldconfig.

        The most recent stable release of the ld package is 1.7.14
        At the time of writing, 1.8.x versions of ld are experimental.

1.10)   Why do I get `yy_flush_buffer undefined' errors?

        This isn't really Linux specific, but is common on older Linux
        installations. You must have a recent version of flex (2.5.2 or later)
        to compile Postgres95. Note that flex 2.5.3 has a bug: see
        Question 3.4.

1.11)   How do I compile Postgres95 on an a.out system?

        First, you must install the dld library. This may be obtained
        from Sunsite as:
        Linux/libs/dld.3.2.7.tar.gz

        Second, comment out the LINUX_ELF line in src/mk/port/postgres.mk.linux

1.12)   Why does make fail with:
        yacc -d /disk2/postgres95/src/backend/parser/gram.y
        make: /usr/bin/make: cannot execute binary file

        yacc is generally implemented as a script which invokes bison -y
        For some reason (certain versions of make? certain versions of 
        bash?) make is unable to execute this script file.

        To correct this, simply edit src/mk/port/postgres.mk.linux
        and, at the end of the file, change:
                # YACC = bison -y
        to
                YACC = bison -y

1.13)   What are the references in X11_LIB to libsocket and libnsl in
        src/Makefile.global?

        This was a problem in 1.08 (they are Sun Solaris specific). 
        It is fixed in 1.09.

1.14)   [DEBIAN] Where is libtermcap?

        Debian Linux comes without the termcap library and uses ncurses
        (which uses terminfo instead). There is no need to change the 
        LIBCURSES variable in src/bin/psql/Makefile since Debian provides 
        a link from libncurses to libcurses (unlike SuSE-Linux --- see
        Question 1.8).

        Edit src/bin/psql/Makefile and change:

                ifeq ($(PORTNAME), linux)
                LD_ADD += -ltermcap
                else

        to

                ifeq ($(PORTNAME), linux)
                CFLAGS += 
                else




----------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 2:      Compiling accessory programs
----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1)    The linker fails to find libX11 when compiling pgtclsh

        Modify the src/Makefile.global to change
                X11_LIBDIR = /usr/lib
        to
                X11_LIBDIR = /usr/X11R6/lib


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 3:      Runtime Problems
----------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1)    I get an error reporting _fUnKy_POSTPORT_sTuFf_ undefined when 
        running scripts like createuser

        This is a bug in V1.06-V1.07 of Postgres and is fixed in V1.08

3.2)    I run postmaster and after that system says 'Bad system call(Core 
        dumped)'

        This indicates that you have no compiled shared memory support 
        into your kernel. You need to recompile the Linux kernel to add this 
        feature.


3.3)    When I try to start the Postmaster, why do I get an error of the form
        Failed Assertion("!(file != 0):(null)", File: 
        "/usr/local/postgres95/src/backend/storage/file/fd.c", Line: 257)
        !(file != 0) (0)
        initdb: could not create template database
        initdb: cleaning up.

        Your permissions on the file /dev/null are wrong. 

        ls -l /dev/null should give you something like:

                crw-rw-rw-  1 root  wheel    2,   2 Oct  8 18:41 /dev/null

        Correct the permissions using:

                chmod a+rw /dev/null

3.4)    Why doesn't createuser work?

        There is a problem with Version 2.5.3 of GNU flex and createuser. 
        Your options are to downgrade flex to V2.5.2, apply a patch to
        V2.5.3 (supplied in doc/README.flex) or wait for V2.5.4 which 
        will fix the bug.

3.5)    Why do I get an error like:
        IpcMemoryCreate: memKey=155356396 , size=760632 ,
        permission=384IpcMemoryCreate: shmget(..., create, ...)
        failed: Invalid argument

        You haven't build IPC support into your Linux kernel. You
        will have to rebuild the kernel and switch on this option.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 4:      Spurious Problems in Need of Verification
----------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1)    Why doesn't the postmaster start the first time?

        Pawko Olszewski <alder@amg.com.pl> reported a problem that, using
        Linux kernel 2.0.18, the postmaster wouldn't start the first time 
        it is run using

                postmaster -B 256

        but if run as

                postmaster -B 64

        killed and then restarted as

                postmaster -B 256

        everything was OK.

        I haven't been able to repeat this problem! Nobody else has
        reported anything similar.
