These utilities help clean up #include file usage.  They should be run
in this order so that the include files have the proper includes before
the C files are tested.

pgfixinclude	change #include's to <> or ""

pgcompinclude [-v]
		report which #include files can not compile on their own

pgrminclude [-v]
		remove extra #include's

pgcheckdefines
		check for #ifdef tests on symbols defined in files that
		weren't included --- this is a necessary sanity check on
		pgrminclude!

pgdefine	create macro calls for all defines in the file (used by
		the above routines)

It is also a good idea to sort the pg-specific include files in
alphabetic order.  This is best done with a text editor. Typical usage
order would be:

	pgfixinclude  
	pgcompinclude
	pgrminclude /src/include
	pgcompinclude
	pgrminclude /
	pgcheckdefines
