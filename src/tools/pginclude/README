These utilities help clean up #include file usage.  They should be run
in this order so that the include files have the proper includes before
the C files are tested.

pgfixinclude	change #include's to <> or ""

pgcompinclude [-v]
		report which #include files can not compile on their own

pgrminclude [-v]
		remove extra #include's

pgdefine	create macro calls for all defines in the file (used by
		the above routines)
