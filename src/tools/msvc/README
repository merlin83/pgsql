This directory contains the tools required to build PostgreSQL using
Microsoft Visual Studio 2005.


Note that PostgreSQL builds natively with Visual C++. You must therefore
make sure that you do *NOT* have any tools from Cygwin or Mingw present
in the system PATH. Also, make sure you don't have any Cygwin/Mingw
environment variables "leaking" through.

First, edit config.pl to reflect what "configure options" you want set.

If you need to modify the environment for calling external tools, such as
flex or bison, create a file called "buildenv.bat". This file will be called
by all scripts before anything is done, so the environment can be set up.
(for example, include SET PATH=%PATH%;c:\some\where\bison\bin)

Then, to build all of PostgreSQL in debug configuration, run the command
	build
from a Visual Studio Command Prompt (to get all environment
variables set correctly).

To build all of PostgreSQL in release configuration, run
	build RELEASE

To build just a single project, for example psql, run
	build psql
or
	build RELEASE psql


Dependencies
------------

The following packages are needed for the different config options:

pthreads - always required
Download from ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/pthreads-win32

perl - always required
Get ActiveState Perl from www.activestate.com

flex & bison - required to build from CVS (as opposed to a release tarball)
Download from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net.  Note that bison version 2.0
will not work.  Use either version 1.875, or version 2.1 or newer.
For flex, use version 2.5.4.

python - required for pl/python
Get from www.python.org

tcl - required for pl/tcl
Get ActiveState TCL from www.activestate.com

openssl - required for SSL support
Get from http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html, or build
from source from www.openssl.org.

Kerberos - required for Kerberos support
Get from http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/dist/index.html

zlib - required for compression support in pg_dump/pg_restore
Get from http://www.zlib.net

libxml2 and libxslt - required for XML support
Get from http://www.zlatkovic.com/pub/libxml or build from source from
