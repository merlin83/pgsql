This directory contains the tools required to build PostgreSQL using
Microsoft Visual Studio 2005.


Note that PostgreSQL builds natively with Visual C++. You must therefore
make sure that you do *NOT* have any tools from Cygwin or Mingw present
in the system PATH. Also, make sure you don't have any Cygwin/Mingw
environment variables "leaking" through.

First, edit config.pl to reflect what "configure options" you want set.

Then, to build all of PostgreSQL in debug configuration, run the command
	build
from a Visual Studio Command Prompt (to get all environment
variables set correctly).

To build all of PostgreSQL in release configuration, run
	build RELEASE

To build just a single project, for example psql, run
	build psql
or
	build RELEASE psql
