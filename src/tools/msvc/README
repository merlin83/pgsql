This directory contains the tools required to build PostgreSQL using
Microsoft Visual Studio 2005. This builds the whole backend, not just
the libpq frontend library. For more information, see the documentation
chapter "Installation on Windows".


Notes about code indention
--------------------------
If the perl code is modified, use perltidy on it since pgindent won't
touch perl code. Use the following commandline:
perltidy -b -bl -nsfs -naws -l=100 *.pl *.pm
