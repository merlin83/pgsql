This program should be run by developers wishing to enable threading on
new platforms.

Run thread_test program to determine if your native libc functions are
thread-safe, or if we should use *_r functions or thread locking.

Make sure you have added any needed 'THREAD_CPPFLAGS' and 'THREAD_LIBS'
defines to your template/${port} file before compiling this program.
