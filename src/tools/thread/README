This program should be run by developers wishing to enable threading on
new platforms.

Run thread_test program to determine if your native libc functions are
thread-safe, or if we should use *_r functions or thread locking.

To use this program, you must:

	o run "configure --enable-thread-safety"
	o compile the main source tree
	o compile and run this program

If your platform requires special thread flags that are not tested by
/config/acx_pthread.m4, add PTHREAD_CFLAGS and PTHREAD_LIBS defines to 
your template/${port} file.
