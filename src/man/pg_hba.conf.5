.SH NAME
$PGDATA/pg_hba.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
"Host-based access control" is the name for the basic controls Postgres
exercises on what clients are allowed to access a database system.
It is called that because one of the factors that can control access is
from what host the client is connecting.
.PP
Each database system contains a file named "pg_hba.conf", in its PGDATA
directory, that controls who can connect to that database system.
.PP
The exact format of the pg_hba.conf file is described in the comments at
the top of the sample file pg_hba.conf.sample, which resides in the 
the PostgreSQL "lib" sub-directory of the main postgres directory.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
