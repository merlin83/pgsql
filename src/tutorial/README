This directory contains SQL tutorial scripts.  To look at them, first do a
	% make
to compile all the scripts and C files for the user-defined functions
and types.  (make needs to be GNU make and may be named something
different on your system)

Then, change to the object directory
	% cd obj

and run psql with the -s flag:
	% psql -s

Welcome to the POSTGRES95 interactive sql monitor:

   type \? for help on slash commands
   type \q to quit
   type \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
 You are currently connected to the database: jolly

From within psql, you can try each individual script file by using
the \i <filename> psql command.
