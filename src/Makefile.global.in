# NOTES
#    Essentially all Postgres make files include this file and use the
#    variables it sets.
#
#    To override the default setting, create a Makefile.custom in this
#    directory and put your defines there. (Makefile.custom is included
#    near the end of this file).  Sometimes, a variable gets set in
#    Makefile.global after Makefile.custom has been included, so you can't
#    simply set that variable in Makefile.custom.  In those cases, there is
#    often another variable (like CUSTOM_COPT) that you can set in
#    Makefile.custom that influences the later setting of the true variable
#    of interest (like CFLAGS) by Makefile.global.
#
#
#    If you change any of these defines you probably have to
#       make clean; make
#    since no dependencies are created for these. (of course you can
#    be crafty and check what files really depend on them and just remake
#    those).
#
#    Before including this file, you must set the SRCDIR variable to the
#    path of the top of the Postgres source tree (the directory that
#    contains this file).

# COPT
#
# COPT is for options that the sophisticated builder might want to vary
# from one build to the next, like options to build Postgres with debugging
# information included.  COPT is meant to be set on the make command line,
# for example with the command "make COPT=-g".  The value you see set here
# is the default that gets used if the builder does not give a value for
# COPT on his make command.
#
# There is a nonobvious relationship between -O (optimization) and
# -Werror (consider all warnings fatal).  On some systems, if you don't
# optimize, you will always get some warnings because the system header
# files will include some unreferenced functions in the code.  These are
# functions that are supposed to be inline, so there wouldn't ordinarily
# be an "unreferenced" problem, but if you don't enable optimization, no
# inlining can happen, and hence the problem.  Therefore, we include
# if you override -O, you override -Werror as well.
#
# CUSTOM_COPT is something the user may set in Makefile.custom

# Common values for COPT are: -g for debuggable binaries, -m486 if you are
# using a i486 or better.

# Automatic dependency generation
# -------------------------------
# When we configure with --enable-depend then we override the default
# compilation rule with the magic below. While or after creating the
# actual output file we also create a dependency list for the .c file.
# Next time we invoke make we will have top-notch information about
# whether this file needs to be updated. The dependency files are kept
# in the .deps subdirectory of each directory.
#
# The sed command is necessary to post-process the dependency file:
# Each dependency file becomes a target of its own, without
# dependencies or commands. This is because if you happen to remove a
# file that is a dependency (say, you rename a header file) the
# dependency would point to a non-existing file and make would fail.
# But if the file is listed as a target of its own, without
# prerequisites and commands, and doesn't exist then make will
# consider it updated. (That in turn also has the nice side effect
# that make will update all files that depended on the now removed
# file.)
