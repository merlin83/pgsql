# About strdup:  Some systems have strdup in their standard library, others
# don't.  Ones that don't will use this make file to compile the strdup.c
# in this directory.  (You don't see strdup mentioned because the implicit
# rule does the job).  We don't make strdup.o unless asked to explicitly
# because the strdup.c in this directory may conflict with the strdup()
# prototype from the system library and cause a compile error.
