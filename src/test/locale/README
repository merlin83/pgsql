   This directory contains a set of tests for locales. I provided one C
program test-ctype.c to test CTYPE support in libc and installed
localedata. Then there are test-sort.pl and test-sort.py that tests
collating. (Also there is test-sort.py but it is commented out in scripts;
uncomment it if you have Python interpreter installed).
   To run a test for some locale (koi8, e.g) run
make all test-$locale
   (for example)
make all test-koi8

   Currently, only tests for koi8 locale (russian cyrillic for UN*X)
provided in koi8 directory. Script `runall' calls test-pgsql-locale to test
whether locale support had been compiled into PotgreSQL, test-ctype to test
libc and localedata, test-sort.pl (uncomment test-sort.py, if you have
Python interpreter installed) and does tests on PostgreSQL with
test-koi8*.sql.in.

   To add locale tests one need to create directory $locale and create
Makefile (and other files) similar to koi8-r/*. Actually, the simplest (I
think) method is just copy koi8-r directory and edit/replace files.
