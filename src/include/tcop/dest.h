 *
 * dest.h
 *	  support for communication destinations
 *
 * Whenever the backend executes a query, the results
 * have to go someplace.
 *
 *	  - stdout is the destination only when we are running a
 *		standalone backend (no postmaster) and are returning results
 *		back to an interactive user.
 *
 *	  - a remote process is the destination when we are
 *		running a backend with a frontend and the frontend executes
 *		PQexec() or PQfn().  In this case, the results are sent
 *		to the frontend via the functions in backend/libpq.
 *
 *	  - None is the destination when the system executes
 *		a query internally.  The results are discarded.
 *
 * dest.c defines three functions that implement destination management:
 *
 * BeginCommand: initialize the destination at start of command.
 * DestToFunction: return a pointer to a struct of destination-specific
 * receiver functions.
 * EndCommand: clean up the destination at end of command.
 *
 * BeginCommand/EndCommand are executed once per received SQL query.
 *
 * DestToFunction, and the receiver functions it links to, are executed
 * each time we run the executor to produce tuples, which may occur
 * multiple times per received query (eg, due to additional queries produced
 * by rewrite rules).
 *
 * The DestReceiver object returned by DestToFunction may be a statically
 * allocated object (for destination types that require no local state)
 * or can be a palloc'd object that has DestReceiver as its first field
 * and contains additional fields (see printtup.c for an example).	These
 * additional fields are then accessible to the DestReceiver functions
 * by casting the DestReceiver* pointer passed to them.
 * The palloc'd object is pfree'd by the DestReceiver's cleanup function.
