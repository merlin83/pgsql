 * dest.h
 *		Whenever the backend executes a query, the results
 *		have to go someplace - either to the standard output,
 *		to a local portal buffer or to a remote portal buffer.
 *
 *	  - stdout is the destination only when we are running a
 *		backend without a postmaster and are returning results
 *		back to the user.
 *
 *	  - a local portal buffer is the destination when a backend
 *		executes a user-defined function which calls PQexec() or
 *		PQfn().  In this case, the results are collected into a
 *		PortalBuffer which the user's function may diddle with.
 *
 *	  - a remote portal buffer is the destination when we are
 *		running a backend with a frontend and the frontend executes
 *		PQexec() or PQfn().  In this case, the results are sent
 *		to the frontend via the pq_ functions.
 *
 *	  - None is the destination when the system executes
 *		a query internally.  This is not used now but it may be
 *		useful for the parallel optimiser/executor.
 *
 * dest.c defines three functions that implement destination management:
 *
 * BeginCommand: initialize the destination.
 * DestToFunction: return a pointer to a struct of destination-specific
 * receiver functions.
 * EndCommand: clean up the destination when output is complete.
 *
 * The DestReceiver object returned by DestToFunction may be a statically
 * allocated object (for destination types that require no local state)
 * or can be a palloc'd object that has DestReceiver as its first field
 * and contains additional fields (see printtup.c for an example).	These
 * additional fields are then accessible to the DestReceiver functions
 * by casting the DestReceiver* pointer passed to them.
 * The palloc'd object is pfree'd by the DestReceiver's cleanup function.
 *
 * XXX FIXME: the initialization and cleanup code that currently appears
 * in-line in BeginCommand and EndCommand probably should be moved out
 * to routines associated with each destination receiver type.
