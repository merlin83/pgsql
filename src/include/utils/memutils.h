 *****************************************************************************/
/*
 * Description:
 *		An allocation set is a set containing allocated elements.  When
 *		an allocation is requested for a set, memory is allocated and a
 *		pointer is returned.  Subsequently, this memory may be freed or
 *		reallocated.  In addition, an allocation set may be reset which
 *		will cause all memory allocated within it to be freed.
 *
 *		XXX The following material about allocation modes is all OUT OF DATE.
 *		aset.c currently implements only one allocation strategy,
 *		DynamicAllocMode, and that's the only one anyone ever requests anyway.
 *		If we ever did have more strategies, the new ones might or might
 *		not look like what is described here...
 *
 *		Allocations may occur in four different modes.	The mode of
 *		allocation does not affect the behavior of allocations except in
 *		terms of performance.  The allocation mode is set at the time of
 *		set initialization.  Once the mode is chosen, it cannot be changed
 *		unless the set is reinitialized.
 *
 *		"Dynamic" mode forces all allocations to occur in a heap.  This
 *		is a good mode to use when small memory segments are allocated
 *		and freed very frequently.	This is a good choice when allocation
 *		characteristics are unknown.  This is the default mode.
 *
 *		"Static" mode attempts to allocate space as efficiently as possible
 *		without regard to freeing memory.  This mode should be chosen only
 *		when it is known that many allocations will occur but that very
 *		little of the allocated memory will be explicitly freed.
 *
 *		"Tunable" mode is a hybrid of dynamic and static modes.  The
 *		tunable mode will use static mode allocation except when the
 *		allocation request exceeds a size limit supplied at the time of set
 *		initialization.  "Big" objects are allocated using dynamic mode.
 *
 *		"Bounded" mode attempts to allocate space efficiently given a limit
 *		on space consumed by the allocation set.  This restriction can be
 *		considered a "soft" restriction, because memory segments will
 *		continue to be returned after the limit is exceeded.  The limit is
 *		specified at the time of set initialization like for tunable mode.
 *
 * Note:
 *		Allocation sets are not automatically reset on a system reset.
 *		Higher level code is responsible for cleaning up.
 *
 *		There may be other modes in the future.
