/*
 * Certain options can only be set at certain times. The rules are
 * like this:
 *
 * POSTMASTER options can only be set when the postmaster starts,
 * either from the configuration file or the command line.
 *
 * SIGHUP options can only be set at postmaster startup or by changing
 * the configuration file and sending the HUP signal to the postmaster
 * or a backend process. (Notice that the signal receipt will not be
 * evaluated immediately. The postmaster and the backend block at a
 * certain point in their main loop. It's safer to wait than to read a
 * file asynchronously.)
 *
 * BACKEND options can only be set at postmaster startup or with the
 * PGOPTIONS variable from the client when the connection is
 * initiated. Note that you cannot change this kind of option using
 * the SIGHUP mechanism, that would defeat the purpose of this being
 * fixed for a given backend once started.
 *
 * SUSET options can be set at postmaster startup, with the SIGHUP
 * mechanism, or from SQL if you're a superuser. These options cannot
 * be set using the PGOPTIONS mechanism, because there is not check as
 * to who does this.
 *
 * USERSET options can be set by anyone any time.
