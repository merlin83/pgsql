 * MaxTupleAttributeNumber limits the number of (user) columns in a tuple.
 * The key limit on this value is that the size of the fixed overhead for
 * a tuple, plus the size of the null-values bitmap (at 1 bit per column),
 * plus MAXALIGN alignment, must fit into t_hoff which is uint8.  On most
 * machines the upper limit without making t_hoff wider would be a little
 * over 1700.  We use round numbers here and for MaxHeapAttributeNumber
 * so that alterations in HeapTupleHeaderData layout won't change the

/*----------
 * MaxHeapAttributeNumber limits the number of (user) columns in a table.
 * This should be somewhat less than MaxTupleAttributeNumber.  It must be
 * at least one less, else we will fail to do UPDATEs on a maximal-width
 * table (because UPDATE has to form working tuples that include CTID).
 * In practice we want some additional daylight so that we can gracefully
 * support operations that add hidden "resjunk" columns, for example
 * SELECT * FROM wide_table ORDER BY foo, bar, baz.
 * In any case, depending on column data types you will likely be running
 * into the disk-block-based limit on overall tuple size if you have more
 * than a thousand or so columns.  TOAST won't help.

/*----------
 * Heap tuple header.  To avoid wasting space, the fields should be
 * layed out in such a way to avoid structure padding.
 *
 * Datums of composite types (row types) share the same general structure
 * as on-disk tuples, so that the same routines can be used to build and
 * examine them.  However the requirements are slightly different: a Datum
 * does not need any transaction visibility information, and it does need
 * a length word and some embedded type information.  We can achieve this
 * by overlaying the xmin/cmin/xmax/cmax/xvac fields of a heap tuple
 * with the fields needed in the Datum case.  Typically, all tuples built
 * in-memory will be initialized with the Datum fields; but when a tuple is
 * about to be inserted in a table, the transaction fields will be filled,
 * overwriting the datum fields.
 *
 * The overall structure of a heap tuple looks like:
 *			fixed fields (HeapTupleHeaderData struct)
 *			nulls bitmap (if HEAP_HASNULL is set in t_infomask)
 *			alignment padding (as needed to make user data MAXALIGN'd)
 *			object ID (if HEAP_HASOID is set in t_infomask)
 *			user data fields
 *
 * We store five "virtual" fields Xmin, Cmin, Xmax, Cmax, and Xvac in four
 * physical fields.  Xmin, Cmin and Xmax are always really stored, but
 * Cmax and Xvac share a field.  This works because we know that there are
 * only a limited number of states that a tuple can be in, and that Cmax
 * is only interesting for the lifetime of the deleting transaction.
 * This assumes that VACUUM FULL never tries to move a tuple whose Cmax
 * is still interesting (ie, delete-in-progress).
 *
 * Note that in 7.3 and 7.4 a similar idea was applied to Xmax and Cmin.
 * However, with the advent of subtransactions, a tuple may need both Xmax
 * and Cmin simultaneously, so this is no longer possible.
 *
 * Following the fixed header fields, the nulls bitmap is stored (beginning
 * at t_bits).	The bitmap is *not* stored if t_infomask shows that there
 * are no nulls in the tuple.  If an OID field is present (as indicated by
 * t_infomask), then it is stored just before the user data, which begins at
 * the offset shown by t_hoff.	Note that t_hoff must be a multiple of
 * MAXALIGN.
