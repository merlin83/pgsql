 * RelOptInfo
 *		Per-relation information for planning/optimization
 *
 * For planning purposes, a "base rel" is either a plain relation (a table)
 * or the output of a sub-SELECT or function that appears in the range table.
 * In either case it is uniquely identified by an RT index.  A "joinrel"
 * is the joining of two or more base rels.  A joinrel is identified by
 * the set of RT indexes for its component baserels.  We create RelOptInfo
 * nodes for each baserel and joinrel, and store them in the Query's
 * base_rel_list and join_rel_list respectively.
 *
 * Note that there is only one joinrel for any given set of component
 * baserels, no matter what order we assemble them in; so an unordered
 * set is the right datatype to identify it with.
 *
 * We also have "other rels", which are like base rels in that they refer to
 * single RT indexes; but they are not part of the join tree, and are stored
 * in other_rel_list not base_rel_list.
 *
 * Currently the only kind of otherrels are those made for child relations
 * of an inheritance scan (SELECT FROM foo*).  The parent table's RTE and
 * corresponding baserel represent the whole result of the inheritance scan.
 * The planner creates separate RTEs and associated RelOptInfos for each child
 * table (including the parent table, in its capacity as a member of the
 * inheritance set).  These RelOptInfos are physically identical to baserels,
 * but are otherrels because they are not in the main join tree.  These added
 * RTEs and otherrels are used to plan the scans of the individual tables in
 * the inheritance set; then the parent baserel is given an Append plan
 * comprising the best plans for the individual child tables.
 *
 * At one time we also made otherrels to represent join RTEs, for use in
 * handling join alias Vars.  Currently this is not needed because all join
 * alias Vars are expanded to non-aliased form during preprocess_expression.
 *
 * Parts of this data structure are specific to various scan and join
 * mechanisms.	It didn't seem worth creating new node types for them.
 *
 *		relids - Set of base-relation identifiers; it is a base relation
 *				if there is just one, a join relation if more than one
 *		rows - estimated number of tuples in the relation after restriction
 *			   clauses have been applied (ie, output rows of a plan for it)
 *		width - avg. number of bytes per tuple in the relation after the
 *				appropriate projections have been done (ie, output width)
 *		reltargetlist - List of Var nodes for the attributes we need to
 *						output from this relation (in no particular order)
 *						NOTE: in a child relation, may contain RowExprs
 *		pathlist - List of Path nodes, one for each potentially useful
 *				   method of generating the relation
 *		cheapest_startup_path - the pathlist member with lowest startup cost
 *								(regardless of its ordering)
 *		cheapest_total_path - the pathlist member with lowest total cost
 *							  (regardless of its ordering)
 *		cheapest_unique_path - for caching cheapest path to produce unique
 *							   (no duplicates) output from relation
 *
 * If the relation is a base relation it will have these fields set:
 *
 *		relid - RTE index (this is redundant with the relids field, but
 *				is provided for convenience of access)
 *		rtekind - distinguishes plain relation, subquery, or function RTE
 *		min_attr, max_attr - range of valid AttrNumbers for rel
 *		attr_needed - array of bitmapsets indicating the highest joinrel
 *				in which each attribute is needed; if bit 0 is set then
 *				the attribute is needed as part of final targetlist
 *		attr_widths - cache space for per-attribute width estimates;
 *					  zero means not computed yet
 *		indexlist - list of IndexOptInfo nodes for relation's indexes
 *					(always NIL if it's not a table)
 *		pages - number of disk pages in relation (zero if not a table)
 *		tuples - number of tuples in relation (not considering restrictions)
 *		subplan - plan for subquery (NULL if it's not a subquery)
 *
 *		Note: for a subquery, tuples and subplan are not set immediately
 *		upon creation of the RelOptInfo object; they are filled in when
 *		set_base_rel_pathlist processes the object.
 *
 *		For otherrels that are inheritance children, these fields are filled
 *		in just as for a baserel.
 *
 * The presence of the remaining fields depends on the restrictions
 * and joins that the relation participates in:
 *
 *		baserestrictinfo - List of RestrictInfo nodes, containing info about
 *					each qualification clause in which this relation
 *					participates (only used for base rels)
 *		baserestrictcost - Estimated cost of evaluating the baserestrictinfo
 *					clauses at a single tuple (only used for base rels)
 *		outerjoinset - For a base rel: if the rel appears within the nullable
 *					side of an outer join, the set of all relids
 *					participating in the highest such outer join; else NULL.
 *					Otherwise, unused.
 *		joininfo  - List of JoinInfo nodes, containing info about each join
 *					clause in which this relation participates
 *		index_outer_relids - only used for base rels; set of outer relids
 *					that participate in indexable joinclauses for this rel
 *		index_inner_paths - only used for base rels; list of InnerIndexscanInfo
 *					nodes showing best indexpaths for various subsets of
 *					index_outer_relids.
 *
 * Note: Keeping a restrictinfo list in the RelOptInfo is useful only for
 * base rels, because for a join rel the set of clauses that are treated as
 * restrict clauses varies depending on which sub-relations we choose to join.
 * (For example, in a 3-base-rel join, a clause relating rels 1 and 2 must be
 * treated as a restrictclause if we join {1} and {2 3} to make {1 2 3}; but
 * if we join {1 2} and {3} then that clause will be a restrictclause in {1 2}
 * and should not be processed again at the level of {1 2 3}.)	Therefore,
 * the restrictinfo list in the join case appears in individual JoinPaths
 * (field joinrestrictinfo), not in the parent relation.  But it's OK for
 * the RelOptInfo to store the joininfo lists, because those are the same
 * for a given rel no matter how we form it.
 *
 * We store baserestrictcost in the RelOptInfo (for base relations) because
 * we know we will need it at least once (to price the sequential scan)
 * and may need it multiple times to price index scans.
 *
 * outerjoinset is used to ensure correct placement of WHERE clauses that
 * apply to outer-joined relations; we must not apply such WHERE clauses
 * until after the outer join is performed.

 * IndexPath represents an index scan.	Although an indexscan can only read

 *
 * 'indexinfo' is a list of IndexOptInfo nodes, one per scan to be performed.
 *
 * 'indexclauses' is a list of index qualifications, also one per scan.
 * Each entry in 'indexclauses' is a sublist of qualification clauses to be

 * derived indexscannable conditions in 'indexquals'.
 *
 * Both 'indexclauses' and 'indexquals' are lists of sublists of RestrictInfo
 * nodes.  (Before 8.0, we kept bare operator expressions in these lists, but

 * is the same as path.parent->rows for a simple indexscan, but it is
 * different for a nestloop inner scan, because the additional indexquals
 * coming from join clauses make the scan more selective than the parent

 * Restriction clause info.

 * ANDed, we can use any one of them or any subset of them to filter out
 * tuples, without having to evaluate the rest.  The RestrictInfo node itself
 * stores data used by the optimizer while choosing the best query plan.
 *
 * If a restriction clause references a single base relation, it will appear
 * in the baserestrictinfo list of the RelOptInfo for that base rel.
 *
 * If a restriction clause references more than one base rel, it will
 * appear in the JoinInfo lists of every RelOptInfo that describes a strict
 * subset of the base rels mentioned in the clause.  The JoinInfo lists are
 * used to drive join tree building by selecting plausible join candidates.
 * The clause cannot actually be applied until we have built a join rel
 * containing all the base rels it references, however.
 *
 * When we construct a join rel that includes all the base rels referenced
 * in a multi-relation restriction clause, we place that clause into the
 * joinrestrictinfo lists of paths for the join rel, if neither left nor
 * right sub-path includes all base rels referenced in the clause.	The clause
 * will be applied at that join level, and will not propagate any further up
 * the join tree.  (Note: the "predicate migration" code was once intended to
 * push restriction clauses up and down the plan tree based on evaluation
 * costs, but it's dead code and is unlikely to be resurrected in the
 * foreseeable future.)
 *
 * Note that in the presence of more than two rels, a multi-rel restriction
 * might reach different heights in the join tree depending on the join
 * sequence we use.  So, these clauses cannot be associated directly with
 * the join RelOptInfo, but must be kept track of on a per-join-path basis.
 *
 * When dealing with outer joins we have to be very careful about pushing qual
 * clauses up and down the tree.  An outer join's own JOIN/ON conditions must
 * be evaluated exactly at that join node, and any quals appearing in WHERE or
 * in a JOIN above the outer join cannot be pushed down below the outer join.
 * Otherwise the outer join will produce wrong results because it will see the
 * wrong sets of input rows.  All quals are stored as RestrictInfo nodes
 * during planning, but there's a flag to indicate whether a qual has been
 * pushed down to a lower level than its original syntactic placement in the
 * join tree would suggest.  If an outer join prevents us from pushing a qual
 * down to its "natural" semantic level (the level associated with just the
 * base rels used in the qual) then the qual will appear in JoinInfo lists
 * that reference more than just the base rels it actually uses.  By
 * pretending that the qual references all the rels appearing in the outer
 * join, we prevent it from being evaluated below the outer join's joinrel.
 * When we do form the outer join's joinrel, we still need to distinguish
 * those quals that are actually in that join's JOIN/ON condition from those
 * that appeared higher in the tree and were pushed down to the join rel
 * because they used no other rels.  That's what the is_pushed_down flag is
 * for; it tells us that a qual came from a point above the join of the
 * specific set of base rels that it uses (or that the JoinInfo structures
 * claim it uses).	A clause that originally came from WHERE will *always*
 * have its is_pushed_down flag set; a clause that came from an INNER JOIN
 * condition, but doesn't use all the rels being joined, will also have
 * is_pushed_down set because it will get attached to some lower joinrel.
 *
 * We also store a valid_everywhere flag, which says that the clause is not
 * affected by any lower-level outer join, and therefore any conditions it
 * asserts can be presumed true throughout the plan tree.
 *
 * In general, the referenced clause might be arbitrarily complex.	The
 * kinds of clauses we can handle as indexscan quals, mergejoin clauses,
 * or hashjoin clauses are fairly limited --- the code for each kind of
 * path is responsible for identifying the restrict clauses it can use
 * and ignoring the rest.  Clauses not implemented by an indexscan,
 * mergejoin, or hashjoin will be placed in the plan qual or joinqual field
 * of the finished Plan node, where they will be enforced by general-purpose
 * qual-expression-evaluation code.  (But we are still entitled to count
 * their selectivity when estimating the result tuple count, if we
 * can guess what it is...)
 *
 * When the referenced clause is an OR clause, we generate a modified copy
 * in which additional RestrictInfo nodes are inserted below the top-level
 * OR/AND structure.  This is a convenience for OR indexscan processing:
 * indexquals taken from either the top level or an OR subclause will have

 * Inner indexscan info.
 *
 * An inner indexscan is one that uses one or more joinclauses as index
 * conditions (perhaps in addition to plain restriction clauses).  So it
 * can only be used as the inner path of a nestloop join where the outer
 * relation includes all other relids appearing in those joinclauses.
 * The set of usable joinclauses, and thus the best inner indexscan,
 * thus varies depending on which outer relation we consider; so we have
 * to recompute the best such path for every join.	To avoid lots of
 * redundant computation, we cache the results of such searches.  For
 * each index we compute the set of possible otherrelids (all relids
 * appearing in joinquals that could become indexquals for this index).
 * Two outer relations whose relids have the same intersection with this
 * set will have the same set of available joinclauses and thus the same
 * best inner indexscan for that index.  Similarly, for each base relation,
 * we form the union of the per-index otherrelids sets.  Two outer relations
 * with the same intersection with that set will have the same best overall
 * inner indexscan for the base relation.  We use lists of InnerIndexscanInfo
 * nodes to cache the results of these searches at both the index and
 * relation level.
 *
 * The search key also includes a bool showing whether the join being
 * considered is an outer join.  Since we constrain the join order for
 * outer joins, I believe that this bool can only have one possible value
 * for any particular base relation; but store it anyway to avoid confusion.
