 *	   This file contains declarations of things that are visible
 *	external to Postgres.  For example, the Oid type is part of a
 *	structure that is passed to the front end via libpq, and is
 *	accordingly referenced in libpq-fe.h.
 *
 *	   Declarations which are specific to a particular interface should
 *	go in the header file for that interface (such as libpq-fe.h).	This
 *	file is only for fundamental Postgres declarations.
 *
 *	   User-written C functions don't count as "external to Postgres."
 *	Those function much as local modifications to the backend itself, and
 *	use header files that are otherwise internal to Postgres to interface
 *	with the backend.
