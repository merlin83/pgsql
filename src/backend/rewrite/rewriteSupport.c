 *
 * NOTE: caller must be holding an appropriate lock on the relation.
 *
 * NOTE: an important side-effect of this operation is that an SI invalidation
 * message is sent out to all backends --- including me --- causing relcache
 * entries to be flushed or updated with the new set of rules for the table.
 * Therefore, we execute the update even if relhasrules has the right value
 * already.  Possible future improvement: skip the disk update and just send
