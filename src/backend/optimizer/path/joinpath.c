 *
 * We also consider mergejoins if mergejoin clauses are available.  We have
 * two ways to generate the inner path for a mergejoin: use the cheapest
 * inner path (sorting it if it's not suitably ordered already), or using an
 * inner path that is already suitably ordered for the merge.  If the
 * cheapest inner path is suitably ordered, then by definition it's the one
 * to use.  Otherwise, we look for ordered paths that are cheaper than the
 * cheapest inner + sort costs.  If we have several mergeclauses, it could be
 * that there is no inner path (or only a very expensive one) for the full
 * list of mergeclauses, but better paths exist if we truncate the
 * mergeclause list (thereby discarding some sort key requirements).  So, we
 * consider truncations of the mergeclause list as well as the full list.
