/*
 *	Explanation of Path.pathkeys
 *
 *	Path.pathkeys is a List of List of Var nodes that represent the sort
 *	order of the result generated by the Path.
 *
 *	In single/base relation RelOptInfo's, the Path's represent various ways
 *	of generate the relation.  Sequential scan Paths have a NIL pathkeys.
 *	Index scans have Path.pathkeys that represent the chosen index.  A
 *	single-key index pathkeys would be { {tab1_indexkey1} }.  The pathkeys
 *	entry for a multi-key index would be { {tab1_indexkey1}, {tab1_indexkey2} }.
 *
 *	Multi-relation RelOptInfo Path's are more complicated.  Mergejoins are
 *	only performed with equajoins("=").  Because of this, the multi-relation
 *	path actually has more than one primary Var key.  For example, a
 *	mergejoin Path of "tab1.col1 = tab2.col1" would generate a pathkeys of
 *	{ {tab1.col1, tab2.col1} }.  This allows future joins to use either Var
 *	as a pre-sorted key to prevent Mergejoins from having to re-sort the Path.
 *	They are equal, so they are both primary sort keys.  This is why pathkeys
 *	is a List of Lists.
 *
 *	For multi-key sorts, if the outer is sorted by a multi-key index, the
 *	multi-key index remains after the join.  If the inner has a multi-key
 *	sort, only the primary key of the inner is added to the result.
 *	Mergejoins only join on the primary key.  Currently, non-primary keys
 *	in the pathkeys List are of limited value.
 *
 *	HashJoin has similar functionality.  NestJoin does not perform sorting,
 *	and allows non-equajoins, so it does not allow useful pathkeys.
