 *

 * equivalent really are (see src/backend/optimizer/README for more info).

 * (including the clauses that originally gave rise to the set!).  The reason

 * there is no longer any need to apply the clause "a = b"; not only is
 * it a waste of time to check it, but we will misestimate selectivity if the
 * clause is left in.  So we must remove it.  For this purpose, any pathkey
 * item that mentions no Vars of the current level can be taken as a constant.
 * (The only case where this would be risky is if the item contains volatile
 * functions; but we will never consider such an expression to be a pathkey
 * at all, because check_mergejoinable() will reject it.)
