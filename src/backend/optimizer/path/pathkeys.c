/*--------------------
 *	Explanation of Path.pathkeys
 *
 *	Path.pathkeys is a List of List of Var nodes that represent the sort
 *	order of the result generated by the Path.
 *
 *	In single/base relation RelOptInfo's, the Path's represent various ways
 *	of generating the relation and the resulting ordering of the tuples.
 *	Sequential scan Paths have NIL pathkeys, indicating no known ordering.
 *	Index scans have Path.pathkeys that represent the chosen index.
 *	A single-key index pathkeys would be { {tab1_indexkey1} }.	For a
 *	multi-key index pathkeys would be { {tab1_indexkey1}, {tab1_indexkey2} },
 *	indicating major sort by indexkey1 and minor sort by indexkey2.
 *
 *	Multi-relation RelOptInfo Path's are more complicated.  Mergejoins are
 *	only performed with equijoins ("=").  Because of this, the multi-relation
 *	path actually has more than one primary Var key.  For example, a
 *	mergejoin Path of "tab1.col1 = tab2.col1" would generate a pathkeys of
 *	{ {tab1.col1, tab2.col1} }, indicating that the major sort order of the
 *	Path can be taken to be *either* tab1.col1 or tab2.col1.
 *	They are equal, so they are both primary sort keys.  This allows future
 *	joins to use either Var as a pre-sorted key to prevent upper Mergejoins
 *	from having to re-sort the Path.  This is why pathkeys is a List of Lists.
 *
 *	Note that while the order of the top list is meaningful (primary vs.
 *	secondary sort key), the order of each sublist is arbitrary.
 *
 *	For multi-key sorts, if the outer is sorted by a multi-key index, the
 *	multi-key index remains after the join.  If the inner has a multi-key
 *	sort, only the primary key of the inner is added to the result.
 *	Mergejoins only join on the primary key.  Currently, non-primary keys
 *	in the pathkeys List are of limited value.
 *
 *	Although Hashjoins also work only with equijoin operators, it is *not*
 *	safe to consider the output of a Hashjoin to be sorted in any particular
 *	order --- not even the outer path's order.  This is true because the
 *	executor might have to split the join into multiple batches.
 *
 *	NestJoin does not perform sorting, and allows non-equijoins, so it does
 *	not allow useful pathkeys.	(But couldn't we use the outer path's order?)
