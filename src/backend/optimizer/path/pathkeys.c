/*--------------------
 *	Explanation of Path.pathkeys
 *
 *	Path.pathkeys is a List of Lists of PathKeyItem nodes that represent
 *	the sort order of the result generated by the Path.  The n'th sublist
 *	represents the n'th sort key of the result.
 *
 *	In single/base relation RelOptInfo's, the Paths represent various ways
 *	of scanning the relation and the resulting ordering of the tuples.
 *	Sequential scan Paths have NIL pathkeys, indicating no known ordering.
 *	Index scans have Path.pathkeys that represent the chosen index's ordering,
 *  if any.  A single-key index would create a pathkey with a single sublist,
 *	e.g. ( (tab1.indexkey1/sortop1) ).  A multi-key index generates a sublist
 *	per key, e.g. ( (tab1.indexkey1/sortop1) (tab1.indexkey2/sortop2) ) which
 *	shows major sort by indexkey1 (ordering by sortop1) and minor sort by
 *	indexkey2 with sortop2.
 *
 *	Note that a multi-pass indexscan (OR clause scan) has NIL pathkeys since
 *	we can say nothing about the overall order of its result.  Also, an
 *	indexscan on an unordered type of index generates NIL pathkeys.  However,
 *	we can always create a pathkey by doing an explicit sort.  The pathkeys
 *	for a sort plan's output just represent the sort key fields and the
 *	ordering operators used.
 *
 *	Things get more interesting when we consider joins.  Suppose we do a
 *	mergejoin between A and B using the mergeclause A.X = B.Y.  The output
 *	of the mergejoin is sorted by X --- but it is also sorted by Y.  We
 *	represent this fact by listing both keys in a single pathkey sublist:
 *	( (A.X/xsortop B.Y/ysortop) ).  This pathkey asserts that the major
 *	sort order of the Path can be taken to be *either* A.X or B.Y.
 *	They are equal, so they are both primary sort keys.  By doing this,
 *	we allow future joins to use either var as a pre-sorted key, so upper
 *	Mergejoins may be able to avoid having to re-sort the Path.  This is
 *	why pathkeys is a List of Lists.
 *
 *	We keep a sortop associated with each PathKeyItem because cross-data-type
 *	mergejoins are possible; for example int4 = int8 is mergejoinable.
 *	In this case we need to remember that the left var is ordered by int4lt
 *	while the right var is ordered by int8lt.  So the different members of
 *	each sublist could have different sortops.
 *
 *	Note that while the order of the top list is meaningful (primary vs.
 *	secondary sort key), the order of each sublist is arbitrary.  Each sublist
 *	should be regarded as a set of equivalent keys, with no significance
 *	to the list order.
 *
 *	With a little further thought, it becomes apparent that pathkeys for
 *	joins need not only come from mergejoins.  For example, if we do a
 *	nestloop join between outer relation A and inner relation B, then any
 *	pathkeys relevant to A are still valid for the join result: we have
 *	not altered the order of the tuples from A.  Even more interesting,
 *	if there was a mergeclause (more formally, an "equijoin clause") A.X=B.Y,
 *	and A.X was a pathkey for the outer relation A, then we can assert that
 *	B.Y is a pathkey for the join result; X was ordered before and still is,
 *	and the joined values of Y are equal to the joined values of X, so Y
 *	must now be ordered too.  This is true even though we used no mergejoin.
 *
 *	More generally, whenever we have an equijoin clause A.X = B.Y and a
 *	pathkey A.X, we can add B.Y to that pathkey if B is part of the joined
 *	relation the pathkey is for, *no matter how we formed the join*.
 *
 *	In short, then: when producing the pathkeys for a merge or nestloop join,
 *	we can keep all of the keys of the outer path, since the ordering of the
 *	outer path will be preserved in the result.  Furthermore, we can add to
 *	each pathkey sublist any inner vars that are equijoined to any of the
 *	outer vars in the sublist; this works regardless of whether we are
 *	implementing the join using that equijoin clause as a mergeclause,
 *	or merely enforcing the clause after-the-fact as a qpqual filter.
 *
 *	Although Hashjoins also work only with equijoin operators, it is *not*
 *	safe to consider the output of a Hashjoin to be sorted in any particular
 *	order --- not even the outer path's order.  This is true because the
 *	executor might have to split the join into multiple batches.  Therefore
 *	a Hashjoin is always given NIL pathkeys.  (Also, we need to use only
 *	mergejoinable operators when deducing which inner vars are now sorted,
 *	because a mergejoin operator tells us which left- and right-datatype
 *	sortops can be considered equivalent, whereas a hashjoin operator
 *	doesn't imply anything about sort order.)
 *
 *	Pathkeys are also useful to represent an ordering that we wish to achieve,
 *	since they are easily compared to the pathkeys of a potential candidate
 *	path.  So, SortClause lists are turned into pathkeys lists for use inside
 *	the optimizer.
 *
 *	OK, now for how it *really* works:
 *
 *	We did implement pathkeys just as described above, and found that the
 *	planner spent a huge amount of time comparing pathkeys, because the
 *	representation of pathkeys as unordered lists made it expensive to decide
 *	whether two were equal or not.  So, we've modified the representation
 *	as described next.
 *
 *	If we scan the WHERE clause for equijoin clauses (mergejoinable clauses)
 *	during planner startup, we can construct lists of equivalent pathkey items
 *	for the query.  There could be more than two items per equivalence set;
 *	for example, WHERE A.X = B.Y AND B.Y = C.Z AND D.R = E.S creates the
 *	equivalence sets { A.X B.Y C.Z } and { D.R E.S } (plus associated sortops).
 *	Any pathkey item that belongs to an equivalence set implies that all the
 *	other items in its set apply to the relation too, or at least all the ones
 *	that are for fields present in the relation.  (Some of the items in the
 *	set might be for as-yet-unjoined relations.)  Furthermore, any multi-item
 *	pathkey sublist that appears at any stage of planning the query *must* be
 *	a subset of one or another of these equivalence sets; there's no way we'd
 *	have put two items in the same pathkey sublist unless they were equijoined
 *	in WHERE.
 *
 *	Now suppose that we allow a pathkey sublist to contain pathkey items for
 *	vars that are not yet part of the pathkey's relation.  This introduces
 *	no logical difficulty, because such items can easily be seen to be
 *	irrelevant; we just mandate that they be ignored.  But having allowed
 *	this, we can declare (by fiat) that any multiple-item pathkey sublist
 *	must be equal() to the appropriate equivalence set.  In effect, whenever
 *	we make a pathkey sublist that mentions any var appearing in an
 *	equivalence set, we instantly add all the other vars equivalenced to it,
 *	whether they appear yet in the pathkey's relation or not.  And we also
 *	mandate that the pathkey sublist appear in the same order as the
 *	equivalence set it comes from.  (In practice, we simply return a pointer
 *	to the relevant equivalence set without building any new sublist at all.)
 *	This makes comparing pathkeys very simple and fast, and saves a lot of
 *	work and memory space for pathkey construction as well.
 *
 *	Note that pathkey sublists having just one item still exist, and are
 *	not expected to be equal() to any equivalence set.  This occurs when
 *	we describe a sort order that involves a var that's not mentioned in
 *	any equijoin clause of the WHERE.  We could add singleton sets containing
 *	such vars to the query's list of equivalence sets, but there's little
 *	point in doing so.
 *
 *	By the way, it's OK and even useful for us to build equivalence sets
 *	that mention multiple vars from the same relation.  For example, if
 *	we have WHERE A.X = A.Y and we are scanning A using an index on X,
 *	we can legitimately conclude that the path is sorted by Y as well;
 *	and this could be handy if Y is the variable used in other join clauses
 *	or ORDER BY.  So, any WHERE clause with a mergejoinable operator can
 *	contribute to an equivalence set, even if it's not a join clause.
