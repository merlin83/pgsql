/*--------------------
 *	Explanation of Path.pathkeys
 *
 *	Path.pathkeys is a List of Lists of PathKeyItem nodes that represent
 *	the sort order of the result generated by the Path.  The n'th sublist
 *	represents the n'th sort key of the result.
 *
 *	In single/base relation RelOptInfo's, the Paths represent various ways
 *	of scanning the relation and the resulting ordering of the tuples.
 *	Sequential scan Paths have NIL pathkeys, indicating no known ordering.
 *	Index scans have Path.pathkeys that represent the chosen index's ordering,
 *  if any.  A single-key index would create a pathkey with a single sublist,
 *	e.g. ( (tab1.indexkey1/sortop1) ).  A multi-key index generates a sublist
 *	per key, e.g. ( (tab1.indexkey1/sortop1) (tab1.indexkey2/sortop2) ) which
 *	shows major sort by indexkey1 (ordering by sortop1) and minor sort by
 *	indexkey2 with sortop2.
 *
 *	Note that a multi-pass indexscan (OR clause scan) has NIL pathkeys since
 *	we can say nothing about the overall order of its result.  Also, an
 *	indexscan on an unordered type of index generates NIL pathkeys.  However,
 *	we can always create a pathkey by doing an explicit sort.
 *
 *	Multi-relation RelOptInfo Path's are more complicated.  Mergejoins are
 *	only performed with equijoins ("=").  Because of this, the resulting
 *	multi-relation path actually has more than one primary key.  For example,
 *	a mergejoin using a clause "tab1.col1 = tab2.col1" would generate pathkeys
 *	of ( (tab1.col1/sortop1 tab2.col1/sortop2) ), indicating that the major
 *	sort order of the Path can be taken to be *either* tab1.col1 or tab2.col1.
 *	They are equal, so they are both primary sort keys.  This allows future
 *	joins to use either var as a pre-sorted key to prevent upper Mergejoins
 *	from having to re-sort the Path.  This is why pathkeys is a List of Lists.
 *
 *	Note that while the order of the top list is meaningful (primary vs.
 *	secondary sort key), the order of each sublist is arbitrary.  No code
 *	working with pathkeys should generate a result that depends on the order
 *	of a pathkey sublist.
 *
 *	We keep a sortop associated with each PathKeyItem because cross-data-type
 *	mergejoins are possible; for example int4=int8 is mergejoinable.  In this
 *	case we need to remember that the left var is ordered by int4lt while
 *	the right var is ordered by int8lt.  So the different members of each
 *	sublist could have different sortops.
 *
 *	When producing the pathkeys for a merge or nestloop join, we can keep
 *	all of the keys of the outer path, since the ordering of the outer path
 *	will be preserved in the result.  We add to each pathkey sublist any inner
 *	vars that are equijoined to any of the outer vars in the sublist.  In the
 *	nestloop case we have to be careful to consider only equijoin operators;
 *	the nestloop's join clauses might include non-equijoin operators.
 *	(Currently, we do this by considering only mergejoinable operators while
 *	making the pathkeys, since we have no separate marking for operators that
 *	are equijoins but aren't mergejoinable.)
 *
 *	Although Hashjoins also work only with equijoin operators, it is *not*
 *	safe to consider the output of a Hashjoin to be sorted in any particular
 *	order --- not even the outer path's order.  This is true because the
 *	executor might have to split the join into multiple batches.  Therefore
 *	a Hashjoin is always given NIL pathkeys.
 *
 *	Pathkeys are also useful to represent an ordering that we wish to achieve,
 *	since they are easily compared to the pathkeys of a potential candidate
 *	path.  So, SortClause lists are turned into pathkeys lists for use inside
 *	the optimizer.
