 * costsize.c
 *	  Routines to compute (and set) relation sizes and path costs
 *
 * Path costs are measured in units of disk accesses: one page fetch
 * has cost 1.  The other primitive unit is the CPU time required to
 * process one tuple, which we set at "cpu_page_weight" of a page
 * fetch.  Obviously, the CPU time per tuple depends on the query
 * involved, but the relative CPU and disk speeds of a given platform
 * are so variable that we are lucky if we can get useful numbers
 * at all.  cpu_page_weight is user-settable, in case a particular
 * user is clueful enough to have a better-than-default estimate
 * of the ratio for his platform.  There is also cpu_index_page_weight,
 * the cost to process a tuple of an index during an index scan.
