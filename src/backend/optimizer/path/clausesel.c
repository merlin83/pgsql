 * clauselist_selectivity -

 *	  must be returned.
 *
 * See clause_selectivity() for the meaning of the varRelid parameter.
 *
 * Our basic approach is to take the product of the selectivities of the
 * subclauses.  However, that's only right if the subclauses have independent
 * probabilities, and in reality they are often NOT independent.  So,
 * we want to be smarter where we can.

 * Currently, the only extra smarts we have is to recognize "range queries",
 * such as "x > 34 AND x < 42".  Clauses are recognized as possible range
 * query components if they are restriction opclauses whose operators have
 * scalarltsel() or scalargtsel() as their restriction selectivity estimator.
 * We pair up clauses of this form that refer to the same variable.  An
 * unpairable clause of this kind is simply multiplied into the selectivity
 * product in the normal way.  But when we find a pair, we know that the
 * selectivities represent the relative positions of the low and high bounds
 * within the column's range, so instead of figuring the selectivity as
 * hisel * losel, we can figure it as hisel + losel - 1.  (To visualize this,
 * see that hisel is the fraction of the range below the high bound, while
 * losel is the fraction above the low bound; so hisel can be interpreted
 * directly as a 0..1 value but we need to convert losel to 1-losel before
 * interpreting it as a value.  Then the available range is 1-losel to hisel.)
 * If the calculation yields zero or negative, however, we chicken out and
 * use the default interpretation; that probably means that one or both
 * selectivities is a default estimate rather than an actual range value.
 * Of course this is all very dependent on the behavior of
 * scalarltsel/scalargtsel; perhaps some day we can generalize the approach.
