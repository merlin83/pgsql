 * pull_up_IN_clauses
 *		Attempt to pull up top-level IN clauses to be treated like joins.
 *
 * A clause "foo IN (sub-SELECT)" appearing at the top level of WHERE can
 * be processed by pulling the sub-SELECT up to become a rangetable entry
 * and handling the implied equality comparisons as join operators (with
 * special join rules).
 * This optimization *only* works at the top level of WHERE, because
 * it cannot distinguish whether the IN ought to return FALSE or NULL in
 * cases involving NULL inputs.  This routine searches for such clauses
 * and does the necessary parsetree transformations if any are found.
 *
 * This routine has to run before preprocess_expression(), so the WHERE
 * clause is not yet reduced to implicit-AND format.  That means we need
 * to recursively search through explicit AND clauses, which are
 * probably only binary ANDs.  We stop as soon as we hit a non-AND item.
 *
 * Returns the possibly-modified version of the given qual-tree node.
