/*
 * join_clause_is_redundant

 *
 * This is the guts of both remove_redundant_join_clauses and
 * select_nonredundant_join_clauses.  See the docs above for motivation.
 *
 * We can detect redundant mergejoinable clauses very cheaply by using their
 * left and right pathkeys, which uniquely identify the sets of equijoined
 * variables in question.  All the members of a pathkey set that are in the
 * left relation have already been forced to be equal; likewise for those in
 * the right relation.	So, we need to have only one clause that checks
 * equality between any set member on the left and any member on the right;
 * by transitivity, all the rest are then equal.
 *
 * However, clauses that are of the form "var expr = const expr" cannot be
 * eliminated as redundant.  This is because when there are const expressions
 * in a pathkey set, generate_implied_equalities() suppresses "var = var"
 * clauses in favor of "var = const" clauses.  We cannot afford to drop any
 * of the latter, even though they might seem redundant by the pathkey
 * membership test.
 *
 * Also, we cannot eliminate clauses wherein one side mentions vars from
 * both relations, as in "WHERE t1.f1 = t2.f1 AND t1.f1 = t1.f2 - t2.f2".
 * In this example, "t1.f2 - t2.f2" could not have been computed at all
 * before forming the join of t1 and t2, so it certainly wasn't constrained
 * earlier.
 *
 * Weird special case: if we have two clauses that seem redundant
 * except one is pushed down into an outer join and the other isn't,
 * then they're not really redundant, because one constrains the
 * joined rows after addition of null fill rows, and the other doesn't.
