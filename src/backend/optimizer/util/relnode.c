/*
 * build_joinrel_restrictlist
 * build_joinrel_joinlist
 *	  These routines build lists of restriction and join clauses for a
 *	  join relation from the joininfo lists of the relations it joins.
 *
 *	  These routines are separate because the restriction list must be
 *	  built afresh for each pair of input sub-relations we consider, whereas
 *	  the join lists need only be computed once for any join RelOptInfo.
 *	  The join lists are fully determined by the set of rels making up the
 *	  joinrel, so we should get the same results (up to ordering) from any
 *	  candidate pair of sub-relations.	But the restriction list is whatever
 *	  is not handled in the sub-relations, so it depends on which
 *	  sub-relations are considered.
 *
 *	  If a join clause from an input relation refers to base rels still not
 *	  present in the joinrel, then it is still a join clause for the joinrel;
 *	  we put it into an appropriate JoinInfo list for the joinrel.	Otherwise,
 *	  the clause is now a restrict clause for the joined relation, and we
 *	  return it to the caller of build_joinrel_restrictlist() to be stored in
 *	  join paths made from this pair of sub-relations.	(It will not need to
 *	  be considered further up the join tree.)
 *
 *	  When building a restriction list, we eliminate redundant clauses.
 *	  We don't try to do that for join clause lists, since the join clauses
 *	  aren't really doing anything, just waiting to become part of higher
 *	  levels' restriction lists.
 *
 * 'joinrel' is a join relation node
 * 'outer_rel' and 'inner_rel' are a pair of relations that can be joined
 *		to form joinrel.
 * 'jointype' is the type of join used.
 *
 * build_joinrel_restrictlist() returns a list of relevant restrictinfos,
 * whereas build_joinrel_joinlist() stores its results in the joinrel's
 * joininfo lists.	One or the other must accept each given clause!
 *
 * NB: Formerly, we made deep(!) copies of each input RestrictInfo to pass
 * up to the join relation.  I believe this is no longer necessary, because
 * RestrictInfo nodes are no longer context-dependent.	Instead, just include
 * the original nodes in the lists made for the join relation.
