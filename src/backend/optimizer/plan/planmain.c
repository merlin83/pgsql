/*--------------------
 * query_planner
 *	  Generate a path (that is, a simplified plan) for a basic query,
 *	  which may involve joins but not any fancier features.
 *
 * Since query_planner does not handle the toplevel processing (grouping,
 * sorting, etc) it cannot select the best path by itself.  It selects
 * two paths: the cheapest path that produces the required tuples, independent
 * of any ordering considerations, and the cheapest path that produces the
 * required tuples in the required ordering, if there is a path that
 * can produce them without an explicit top-level sort step.  The caller
 * (grouping_planner) will make the final decision about which to use.
 *
 * Input parameters:
 * root is the query to plan
 * tlist is the target list the query should produce (NOT root->targetList!)
 * tuple_fraction is the fraction of tuples we expect will be retrieved
 *
 * Output parameters:
 * *cheapest_path receives the overall-cheapest path for the query
 * *sorted_path receives the cheapest presorted path for the query,
 *				if any (it may be NULL, or the same as cheapest_path)
 *
 * Note: the Query node also includes a query_pathkeys field, which is both
 * an input and an output of query_planner().  The input value signals
 * query_planner that the indicated sort order is wanted in the final output
 * plan.  But this value has not yet been "canonicalized", since the needed
 * info does not get computed until we scan the qual clauses.  We canonicalize
 * it as soon as that task is done.  (The main reason query_pathkeys is a
 * Query field and not a passed parameter is that the low-level routines in
 * indxpath.c need to see it.)
 *
 * tuple_fraction is interpreted as follows:
 *	  0 (or less): expect all tuples to be retrieved (normal case)
 *	  0 < tuple_fraction < 1: expect the given fraction of tuples available
 *		from the plan to be retrieved
 *	  tuple_fraction >= 1: tuple_fraction is the absolute number of tuples
 *		expected to be retrieved (ie, a LIMIT specification)
 * Note that while this routine and its subroutines treat a negative
 * tuple_fraction the same as 0, grouping_planner has a different
 * interpretation.
