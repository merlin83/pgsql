/*
 * query_planner
 *	  Routine to create a query plan.  It does so by first creating a
 *	  subplan for the topmost level of attributes in the query.  Then,
 *	  it modifies all target list and qualifications to consider the next
 *	  level of nesting and creates a plan for this modified query by
 *	  recursively calling itself.  The two pieces are then merged together
 *	  by creating a result node that indicates which attributes should
 *	  be placed where and any relation level qualifications to be
 *	  satisfied.
 *
 *	  command-type is the query command, e.g., select, delete, etc.
 *	  tlist is the target list of the query
 *	  qual is the qualification of the query
 *
 *	  Note: the Query node now also includes a query_pathkeys field, which
 *	  is both an input and an output of query_planner().  The input value
 *	  signals query_planner that the indicated sort order is wanted in the
 *	  final output plan.  The output value is the actual pathkeys of the
 *	  selected path.  This might not be the same as what the caller requested;
 *	  the caller must do pathkeys_contained_in() to decide whether an
 *	  explicit sort is still needed.  (The main reason query_pathkeys is a
 *	  Query field and not a passed parameter is that the low-level routines
 *	  in indxpath.c need to see it.)
 *
 *	  Returns a query plan.
