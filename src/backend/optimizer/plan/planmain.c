/*--------------------
 * query_planner
 *	  Generate a plan for a basic query, which may involve joins but
 *	  not any fancier features.
 *
 * tlist is the target list the query should produce (NOT root->targetList!)
 * qual is the qualification of the query (likewise!)
 * tuple_fraction is the fraction of tuples we expect will be retrieved
 *
 * qual must already have been converted to implicit-AND form.
 *
 * Note: the Query node now also includes a query_pathkeys field, which
 * is both an input and an output of query_planner().  The input value
 * signals query_planner that the indicated sort order is wanted in the
 * final output plan.  The output value is the actual pathkeys of the
 * selected path.  This might not be the same as what the caller requested;
 * the caller must do pathkeys_contained_in() to decide whether an
 * explicit sort is still needed.  (The main reason query_pathkeys is a
 * Query field and not a passed parameter is that the low-level routines
 * in indxpath.c need to see it.)  The pathkeys value passed to query_planner
 * has not yet been "canonicalized", since the necessary info does not get
 * computed until subplanner() scans the qual clauses.	We canonicalize it
 * inside subplanner() as soon as that task is done.  The output value
 * will be in canonical form as well.
 *
 * tuple_fraction is interpreted as follows:
 *	  0 (or less): expect all tuples to be retrieved (normal case)
 *	  0 < tuple_fraction < 1: expect the given fraction of tuples available
 *		from the plan to be retrieved
 *	  tuple_fraction >= 1: tuple_fraction is the absolute number of tuples
 *		expected to be retrieved (ie, a LIMIT specification)
 * Note that while this routine and its subroutines treat a negative
 * tuple_fraction the same as 0, union_planner has a different interpretation.
 *
 * Returns a query plan.
