 *	  a process tries to acquire a lock of a type that conflicts
 *	  with existing locks, it is put to sleep using the routines
 *	  in storage/lmgr/proc.c.

 * LockAcquire -- Check for lock conflicts, sleep if conflict found,

 *		but if dontWait is FALSE, only a parameter error can cause
 *		a FALSE return.  (XXX probably we should just ereport on parameter
 *		errors, instead of conflating this with failure to acquire lock?)
 *
 * Side Effects: The lock is acquired and recorded in lock tables.
 *
 * NOTE: if we wait for the lock, there is no way to abort the wait
 * short of aborting the transaction.
 *
 *
 * Note on User Locks:
 *
 *		User locks are handled totally on the application side as
 *		long term cooperative locks which extend beyond the normal
 *		transaction boundaries.  Their purpose is to indicate to an
 *		application that someone is `working' on an item.  So it is
 *		possible to put an user lock on a tuple's oid, retrieve the
 *		tuple, work on it for an hour and then update it and remove
 *		the lock.  While the lock is active other clients can still
 *		read and write the tuple but they can be aware that it has
 *		been locked at the application level by someone.
 *		User locks use lock tags made of an uint16 and an uint32, for
 *		example 0 and a tuple oid, or any other arbitrary pair of
 *		numbers following a convention established by the application.
 *		In this sense tags don't refer to tuples or database entities.
 *		User locks and normal locks are completely orthogonal and
 *		they don't interfere with each other, so it is possible
 *		to acquire a normal lock on an user-locked tuple or user-lock
 *		a tuple for which a normal write lock already exists.
 *		User locks are always non blocking, therefore they are never
 *		acquired if already held by another process.  They must be
 *		released explicitly by the application but they are released
 *		automatically when a backend terminates.
 *		They are indicated by a lockmethod 2 which is an alias for the
 *		normal lock table, and are distinguished from normal locks
 *		by the following differences:
 *
 *										normal lock		user lock
 *
 *		lockmethodid					1				2
 *		tag.dbId						database oid	database oid
 *		tag.relId						rel oid or 0	0
 *		tag.objId						block id		lock id2
 *										or xact id
 *		tag.offnum						0				lock id1
 *		proclock.xid					xid or 0		0
 *		persistence						transaction		user or backend
 *										or backend
 *
 *		The lockmode parameter can have the same values for normal locks
 *		although probably only WRITE_LOCK can have some practical use.
