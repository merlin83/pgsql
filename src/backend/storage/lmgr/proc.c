 *
 * Interface (a):
 *		ProcSleep(), ProcWakeup(),
 *		ProcQueueAlloc() -- create a shm queue for sleeping processes
 *		ProcQueueInit() -- create a queue without allocing memory
 *
 * Locking and waiting for buffers can cause the backend to be
 * put to sleep.  Whoever releases the lock, etc. wakes the
 * process up again (and gives it an error code so it knows
 * whether it was awoken on an error condition).
 *
 * Interface (b):
 *
 * ProcReleaseLocks -- frees the locks associated with current transaction
 *
 * ProcKill -- destroys the shared memory state (and locks)
 *		associated with the process.
 *
 * 5/15/91 -- removed the buffer pool based lock chain in favor
 *		of a shared memory lock chain.	The write-protection is
 *		more expensive if the lock chain is in the buffer pool.
 *		The only reason I kept the lock chain in the buffer pool
 *		in the first place was to allow the lock table to grow larger
 *		than available shared memory and that isn't going to work
 *		without a lot of unimplemented support anyway.
 *
 * 4/7/95 -- instead of allocating a set of 1 semaphore per process, we
 *		allocate a semaphore from a set of PROC_NSEMS_PER_SET semaphores
 *		shared among backends (we keep a few sets of semaphores around).
 *		This is so that we can support more backends. (system-wide semaphore
 *		sets run out pretty fast.)				  -ay 4/95
