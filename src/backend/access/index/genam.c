/*
 * OLD COMMENTS
 * Scans are implemented as follows:
 *
 * `0' represents an invalid item pointer.
 * `-' represents an unknown item pointer.
 * `X' represents a known item pointers.
 * `+' represents known or invalid item pointers.
 * `*' represents any item pointers.
 *
 * State is represented by a triple of these symbols in the order of
 * previous, current, next.  Note that the case of reverse scans works
 * identically.
 *
 *		State	Result
 * (1)	+ + -	+ 0 0			(if the next item pointer is invalid)
 * (2)			+ X -			(otherwise)
 * (3)	* 0 0	* 0 0			(no change)
 * (4)	+ X 0	X 0 0			(shift)
 * (5)	* + X	+ X -			(shift, add unknown)
 *
 * All other states cannot occur.
 *
 * Note:
 *		It would be possible to cache the status of the previous and
 *		next item pointer using the flags.

/* ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *		general access method routines
 *
 *		All indexed access methods use an identical scan structure.
 *		We don't know how the various AMs do locking, however, so we don't
 *		do anything about that here.
 *
 *		The intent is that an AM implementor will define a beginscan routine
 *		that calls RelationGetIndexScan, to fill in the scan, and then does
 *		whatever kind of locking he wants.
 *
 *		At the end of a scan, the AM's endscan routine undoes the locking,
 *		but does *not* call IndexScanEnd --- the higher-level index_endscan
 *		routine does that.	(We can't do it in the AM because index_endscan
 *		still needs to touch the IndexScanDesc after calling the AM.)
 *
 *		Because of this, the AM does not have a choice whether to call
 *		RelationGetIndexScan or not; its beginscan routine must return an
 *		object made by RelationGetIndexScan.  This is kinda ugly but not
 *		worth cleaning up now.

 *	RelationGetIndexScan -- Create and fill an IndexScanDesc.

 *		This routine creates an index scan structure and sets its contents

 *		Parameters:
 *				relation -- index relation for scan.
 *				scanFromEnd -- if true, begin scan at one of the index's
 *							   endpoints.
 *				numberOfKeys -- count of scan keys.
 *				key -- the ScanKey for the starting position of the scan.

 *		heap-or-index-scan access to system catalogs
 *
 *		These functions support system catalog accesses that normally use
 *		an index but need to be capable of being switched to heap scans
 *		if the system indexes are unavailable.  The interface is
 *		as easy to use as a heap scan, and hides all the extra cruft of
 *		the present indexscan API.
 *
 *		The specified scan keys must be compatible with the named index.
 *		Generally this means that they must constrain either all columns
 *		of the index, or the first K columns of an N-column index.
 *
 *		These routines would work fine with non-system tables, actually,
 *		but they're only useful when there is a known index to use with
 *		the given scan keys, so in practice they're only good for
 *		predetermined types of scans of system catalogs.
