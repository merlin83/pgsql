 * This routine is another in the series of attempts to reduce the number
 * of I/O's and system calls executed in the various benchmarks.  In
 * particular, this routine is used to append data to the end of a relation
 * file without excessive lseeks.  This code should do no more than 2 semops
 * in the ideal case.
 *
 * Eventually, we should cache the number of blocks in a relation somewhere.
 * Until that time, this code will have to do an lseek to determine the number
 * of blocks in a relation.
 *
 * This code should ideally do at most 4 semops, 1 lseek, and possibly 1 write
 * to do an append; it's possible to eliminate 2 of the semops if we do direct
 * buffer stuff (!); the lseek and the write can go if we get
 * RelationGetNumberOfBlocks to be useful.
 *
 * NOTE: This code presumes that we have a write lock on the relation.
 * Not now - we use extend locking...
 *
 * Also note that this routine probably shouldn't have to exist, and does
 * screw up the call graph rather badly, but we are wasting so much time and
 * system resources being massively general that we are losing badly in our
 * performance benchmarks.
