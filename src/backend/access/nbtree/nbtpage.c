 *	NOTES
 *	   Postgres btree pages look like ordinary relation pages.	The opaque
 *	   data at high addresses includes pointers to left and right siblings
 *	   and flag data describing page state.  The first page in a btree, page
 *	   zero, is special -- it stores meta-information describing the tree.
 *	   Pages one and higher store the actual tree data.

 *	Since the creating transaction has not committed, no one can see
 *	the index, and there's no reason to share locks.  The second case
 *	is when we're just starting up the database system.  We use some
 *	special-purpose initialization code in the relation cache manager
 *	(see utils/cache/relcache.c) to allow us to do indexed scans on
 *	the system catalogs before we'd normally be able to.  This happens
 *	before the lock table is fully initialized, so we can't use it.
 *	Strictly speaking, this violates 2pl, but we don't do 2pl on the
 *	system catalogs anyway, so I declare this to be okay.
