 * NOTES
 *		This shouldn't be in libpq, but the monitor and some other
 *		things need it...
 *
 *	A NOTE ABOUT SIGNAL HANDLING ACROSS THE VARIOUS PLATFORMS.
 *
 *	config.h defines the macro USE_POSIX_SIGNALS for some platforms and
 *	not for others.  This file and pqsignal.h use that macro to decide
 *	how to handle signalling.
 *
 *	signal(2) handling - this is here because it affects some of
 *	the frontend commands as well as the backend server.
 *
 *	Ultrix and SunOS provide BSD signal(2) semantics by default.
 *
 *	SVID2 and POSIX signal(2) semantics differ from BSD signal(2)
 *	semantics.	We can use the POSIX sigaction(2) on systems that
 *	allow us to request restartable signals (SA_RESTART).
 *
 *	Some systems don't allow restartable signals at all unless we
 *	link to a special BSD library.
 *
 *	We devoutly hope that there aren't any systems that provide
 *	neither POSIX signals nor BSD signals.	The alternative
 *	is to do signal-handler reinstallation, which doesn't work well
 *	at all.
