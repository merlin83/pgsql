# This is the pg_ident.conf file, which is used with Postgres ident-based
# authentication (a subtype of host-based authentication).

# This is a table of ident usernames (typically Unix usernames) and 
# their corresponding Postgres usernames.  For example, user "bryanh" on
# some particular remote system may equate to Postgres user "guest1".

# This file contains multiple maps.  Each has a name.  The pg_hba.conf
# file determines what connections relate to this file and for those that
# do, which map to use.

# Each record consists of 3 tokens:
#
# 1) map name
# 2) ident username
# 3) Postgres username

# Note that it is possible for one user to map to multiple Postgres usernames.
# A user always has to specify when he connects what Postgres username he is
# using.  This file is only used to validate that selection.
