/* NOTES
 *	  This is the module that understands the lowest-level part
 *	  of the communication protocol.  All of the trickiness in
 *	  this module is for making sure that non-blocking I/O in
 *	  the Postmaster works correctly.	Check the notes in PacketRecv
 *	  on non-blocking I/O.
 *
 * Data Structures:
 *		Port has two important functions. (1) It records the
 *		sock/addr used in communication. (2) It holds partially
 *		read in messages.  This is especially important when
 *		we haven't seen enough to construct a complete packet
 *		header.
 *
 * PacketBuf -- None of the clients of this module should know
 *		what goes into a packet hdr (although they know how big
 *		it is).  This routine is in charge of host to net order
 *		conversion for headers.  Data conversion is someone elses
 *		responsibility.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: these routines are called by backends, clients, and
 *		the Postmaster.
