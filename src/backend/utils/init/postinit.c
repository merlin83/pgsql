 *		ReverifyMyDatabase
 *
 * Since we are forced to fetch the database OID out of pg_database without
 * benefit of locking or transaction ID checking (see utils/misc/database.c),
 * we might have gotten a wrong answer.  Or, we might have attached to a
 * database that's in process of being destroyed by destroydb().  This
 * routine is called after we have all the locking and other infrastructure
 * running --- now we can check that we are really attached to a valid
 * database.
 *
 * In reality, if destroydb() is running in parallel with our startup,
 * it's pretty likely that we will have failed before now, due to being
 * unable to read some of the system tables within the doomed database.
 * This routine just exists to make *sure* we have not started up in an
 * invalid database.  If we quit now, we should have managed to avoid
 * creating any serious problems.
 *
 * This is also a handy place to fetch the database encoding info out
 * of pg_database, if we are in MULTIBYTE mode.
