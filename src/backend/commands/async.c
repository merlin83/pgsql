/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * New Async Notification Model:
 * 1. Multiple backends on same machine.  Multiple backends listening on
 *	  one relation.  (Note: "listening on a relation" is not really the
 *	  right way to think about it, since the notify names need not have
 *	  anything to do with the names of relations actually in the database.
 *	  But this terminology is all over the code and docs, and I don't feel
 *	  like trying to replace it.)
 *
 * 2. There is a tuple in relation "pg_listener" for each active LISTEN,
 *	  ie, each relname/listenerPID pair.  The "notification" field of the
 *	  tuple is zero when no NOTIFY is pending for that listener, or the PID
 *	  of the originating backend when a cross-backend NOTIFY is pending.
 *	  (We skip writing to pg_listener when doing a self-NOTIFY, so the
 *	  notification field should never be equal to the listenerPID field.)
 *
 * 3. The NOTIFY statement itself (routine Async_Notify) just adds the target
 *	  relname to a list of outstanding NOTIFY requests.  Actual processing
 *	  happens if and only if we reach transaction commit.  At that time (in
 *	  routine AtCommit_Notify) we scan pg_listener for matching relnames.
 *    If the listenerPID in a matching tuple is ours, we just send a notify
 *	  message to our own front end.  If it is not ours, and "notification"
 *	  is not already nonzero, we set notification to our own PID and send a
 *	  SIGUSR2 signal to the receiving process (indicated by listenerPID).
 *	  BTW: if the signal operation fails, we presume that the listener backend
 *    crashed without removing this tuple, and remove the tuple for it.
 *
 * 4. Upon receipt of a SIGUSR2 signal, the signal handler can call inbound-
 *	  notify processing immediately if this backend is idle (ie, it is
 *	  waiting for a frontend command and is not within a transaction block).
 *    Otherwise the handler may only set a flag, which will cause the
 *	  processing to occur just before we next go idle.
 *
 * 5. Inbound-notify processing consists of scanning pg_listener for tuples
 *	  matching our own listenerPID and having nonzero notification fields.
 *	  For each such tuple, we send a message to our frontend and clear the
 *	  notification field.  BTW: this routine has to start/commit its own
 *	  transaction, since by assumption it is only called from outside any
 *	  transaction.
 *
 * Note that the system's use of pg_listener is confined to very short
 * intervals at the end of a transaction that contains NOTIFY statements,
 * or during the transaction caused by an inbound SIGUSR2.  So the fact that
 * pg_listener is a global resource shouldn't cause too much performance
 * problem.  But application authors ought to be discouraged from doing
 * LISTEN or UNLISTEN near the start of a long transaction --- that would
 * result in holding the pg_listener write lock for a long time, possibly
 * blocking unrelated activity.  It could even lead to deadlock against another
 * transaction that touches the same user tables and then tries to NOTIFY.
 * Probably best to do LISTEN or UNLISTEN outside of transaction blocks.
 *
 * An application that listens on the same relname it notifies will get
 * NOTIFY messages for its own NOTIFYs.  These can be ignored, if not useful,
 * by comparing be_pid in the NOTIFY message to the application's own backend's
 * PID.  (As of FE/BE protocol 2.0, the backend's PID is provided to the
 * frontend during startup.)  The above design guarantees that notifies from
 * other backends will never be missed by ignoring self-notifies.  Note,
 * however, that we do *not* guarantee that a separate frontend message will
 * be sent for every outside NOTIFY.  Since there is only room for one
 * originating PID in pg_listener, outside notifies occurring at about the
 * same time may be collapsed into a single message bearing the PID of the
 * first outside backend to perform the NOTIFY.
