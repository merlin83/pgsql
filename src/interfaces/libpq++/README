This directory contains libpq++, the C++ language interface to POSTGRES95.
libpq++ is implemented on of the libpq library.  Users would benefit
from reading the chapter on libpq in the postgres95 users manual
before using libpq++.

The initial version of this implementation was done by William Wanders
(wwanders@sci.kun.nl)

This is only a preliminary attempt at providing something useful for
people who would like to use C++ to build frontend applications to
postgres95.  The API provided herein is subject to change in later
versions of postgres95.

For details on how to to use libpq++, see the man page in the man/
subdirectory and the test programs in the examples/ subdirectory. 

libpq++ has been tested with g++, version 2.7.0
