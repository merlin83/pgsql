Announce : Release of PyGreSQL version 2.0
===============================================

PyGreSQL v2.0 has been released.
It is available at: ftp://ftp.druid.net/pub/distrib/PyGreSQL-2.0.tgz.

PostgreSQL is a database system derived from Postgres4.2. It conforms to
(most of) ANSI SQL and offers many interesting capabilities (C dynamic linking 
for functions or type definition, etc.). This package is copyright by the 
Regents of the University of California, and is freely distributable.

Python is a interpretated programming langage. It is object oriented, simple
to use (light syntax, simple and straighforward statements), and has many
extensions for building GUIs, interfacing with WWW, etc. An intelligent web  
browser (HotJava like) is currently under development (november 1995), and
this should open programmers many doors. Python is copyrighted by Stichting S
Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and is freely distributable.

PyGreSQL is a python module that interfaces to a PostgreSQL database. It
embeds the PostgreSQL query library to allow easy use of the powerful
PostgreSQL features from a Python script.

PyGreSQL 2.0 was developed and tested on a NetBSD 1.3_BETA system.  It is
based on the PyGres95 code written by Pascal Andre, andre@chimay.via.ecp.fr.
I changed the version to 2.0 and updated the code for Python 1.5 and
PostgreSQL 6.2.1.  While I was at it I upgraded the code to use full ANSI
style prototypes and changed the order of arguments to connect.

Important changes from Pygres95 1.0b to PyGreSQL 2.0:
  - Updated code for PostgreSQL 6.2.1 and Python 1.5.
  - Reformatted code and converted to ANSI .
  - Changed name to PyGreSQL (from PyGres95.)
  - Changed order of arguments to connect function.
  - Created new type pgqueryobject and moved certain methods to it.
  - Added a print function for pgqueryobject
  - Various code changes - mostly stylistic.
