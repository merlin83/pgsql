# cleardbdir.sh--
#    completely clear out the database directory
#
#    A program by this name used to be necessary because the database 
#    files were mixed in with postgres program files.  Now, the database
#    files are in their own directory so you can just rm it.
#
#    We have to ship this program, which now just tells the user there's
#    no such program, to make sure that the old program from
#    a prior release gets deleted.  If it hung around, it could confuse 
#    the user.
