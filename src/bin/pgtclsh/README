pgtclsh is an example of a tclsh extended with the new Tcl
commands provided by the libpgtcl library.  By using pgtclsh, one can
write front-end applications to Postgres95 in Tcl without having to
deal with any libpq programming at all.  

The pgtclsh is an enhanced version of tclsh.  Similarly, pgtksh is a
wish replacement with postgres95 bindings. The Makefile is also set up
so that you can choose "pgtksh" as a target.   

pgtclsh has been tested with the official releases of
	Tcl version 7.4 
and 	Tk  version 4.0 

and will probably not work with versions older than those (including
earlier beta releases). 

For details of the libpgtcl interface, please see the file
src/doc/libpgtcl.doc.
