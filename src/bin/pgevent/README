The files attached with this mail have to be stored in pgevent directory.
MSG000001.bin is a bin files, result of Microsoft MC compiler. MC compiler
can be downloaded for free with MS Core SDK but it is not included with MSYS
tools and I didn't find a alternative way to compile MC file.

To summarize MC pgmsgevent.mc command generates pgmsgevent.h
pgmsgevent.rc and MSG00001.bin files.  In MC file, we declare a string
with %s format, so we can write anything we want in the future without
need to change the definition of this string.

To finish, because DllUnregisterServer and DllRegisterServer are system
defined entry point, we need to export these two functions with their names
without "decoration", so we cannot uses auto generated .def files without
handy modifications.
