More information about libgtcl</H1>
Also, you will need the PostgreSQL to Tcl interface library, lined as a
Tcl/Tk 'load'-able module. It is called libpgtcl and the source is located
in the PostgreSQL directory /src/interfaces/libpgtcl. Specifically, you
will need a libpgtcl library that is 'load'-able from Tcl/Tk. This is technically
different from an ordinary PostgreSQL loadable object file, because libpgtcl
is a collection of object files. Under Linux, this is called libpgtcl.so.
<BR>You can download <A HREF="libpgtcl.so">from here </A>a version already
compiled for Linux i386 systems. Just copy libpgtcl.so into your system
library director (/usr/lib) and go for it. One of the solutions is to remove
from the source the line containing <B>load libpgtcl.so </B>and to load
pgaccess.tcl not with wish, but with pgwish (or wishpg) that wish that
was linked with libpgtcl library!

<P>If you have installed RedHat 5.0, you should get the last distribution
kit of postgreSQL and compile it from scratch. RedHat 5.0 is using some
new versions of libraries and you have to compile and install again at
least <B>libpq </B>and <B><TT>libpgtcl </TT></B>libraries.

<P>However, the application should work without problems!
