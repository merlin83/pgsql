Here are some screenshots from PgAccess windows : <A HREF="pic-pga-1.gif">Main
window </A>, <A HREF="pic-pga-2.gif">table builder </A>, <A HREF="pic-pga-4.gif">table(query)
view </A>, <A HREF="pic-pga-3.gif">visual query builder </A>.
<P><B>Tables</B>
<BR>- opening multiple tables for viewing, max. n records (changed by preferences
menu)
<BR>- column resizing, dragging the vertical grid line (better in table
space rather than in the table header)
<BR>- text wrap in cells - layout saved for every table
<BR>- import/export to external files (SDF,CSV)
<BR>- filter capabilities (enter filter like (price>3.14)
<BR>- sort order capabilities (enter manually the sort field(s))
<BR>- editing in place
<BR>- improved table generator assistant
<BR>- improved field editing
<BR><B>Queries</B>

<BR>- store queries as views
<BR>- execution of queries with optional user input parameters ( select
* from invoices where year=[parameter "Year of selection"] )
<BR>- viewing of select type queries result
<BR>- query deleting and renaming
<BR>- visual query builder with drag &amp; drop capabilities. For any of
you who had installed the Tcl/Tk plugin for Netscape Navigator, you can
see it at work <A HREF="qbtclet.html">clicking here</A>
<BR><B>Sequences</B>
<BR>- defines sequences, delete them and inspect them

More information about libpgtcl - downloads</H1>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, you will need the PostgreSQL to Tcl interface
library, lined as a Tcl/Tk 'load'-able module. It is called libpgtcl and
the source is located in the PostgreSQL directory /src/interfaces/libpgtcl.
Specifically, you will need a libpgtcl library that is 'load'-able from
Tcl/Tk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is technically different from
an ordinary PostgreSQL loadable object file, because libpgtcl is a collection
of object files. Under Linux, this is called libpgtcl.so.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the solutions is to remove from the
source the line containing <B>load libpgtcl.so </B>and to load pgaccess.tcl
not with wish, but with pgwish (or wishpg) that wish that was linked with
libpgtcl library! I do not recommend this one.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have installed RedHat 5.x, you should
get the last distribution kit of PostgreSQL and compile it from scratch.
RedHat 5.x is using some new versions of libraries and you have to compile
and install again at least <B>libpq </B>and <B><TT>libpgtcl </TT></B>libraries.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PostgreSQL 6.4 release has a minor bug. I does not
includ by default the crypt lib when compiling libpgtcl. So, you will need
to manually add a -lcrypt to SHLIB line in Makefile in src/interfaces/libpgtcl
and then make clean and make again. The new libpgtcl.so library is properly
configured to run pgaccess.
