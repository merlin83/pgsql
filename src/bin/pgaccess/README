Hi,

I've made a few changes in the pgaccess source to make it work with overloaded functions too.

The files that I changed are:

    pgaccess:		to run the modified version from the actual directory
    /lib/functions.old:	bugfix for working with overloaded functions, and another one: if somebody has made a mistake 
			in the editing process, the function was deleted, and recreation was not possibble, because the
			program returned an error message. Now the error message is still persists, but the procedure 
			doesn't take this into consideration.
			Added "Save as" button to create a new function with the same source. Very usefull when one needs
			a new function with slight modification to the source code.
			Then default window size is increased to let the larger source code visible without resizing.
    /lib/mainlib.tcl:	for the same bugfix, now the functionnames are represented with the parameters too, I think, that
			the structure is more visible now. Bugfix for the introduced functionalities, at deleteing object
			(function).
    /lib/tables.tcl:	I don't know how, but there is a difference. Maybe this is one of the misteries of the universe :)

So, in spite of the fact that this "hacking" is my first juorney in the tcl scripting language, I think
I've made a good job after all. I hope, this changes will be reflected in the future release of the pgaccess.

There can be several hidden bugs introduced by the changes, if you find one of them please let me know.

At this time I am using the changed software that helps me much more in the actual project.
