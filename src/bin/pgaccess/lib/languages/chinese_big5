        0x0d2C
      ==========

May your signals all trap
    May your references be bounded
All memory aligned
    Floats to ints rounded


Remember ...


Non-zero is true
    ++ adds one
Arrays start with zero
and, NULL is for none


For octal, use zero
    0x means hex
= will set
    == means test


use -&gt; for a pointer
    a dot if its not
? : is confusing
    use them a lot


a.out is your program
        there's no U in foobar
and, char (*(*x())[])() is
        a function returning a pointer
        to an array of pointers to
        functions returning char
